    "about": "I’m a Senior Operator & Builder across digital commerce, consumer-tech, and early-stage to IPO-scale businesses. Over the past 18 years, I’ve helped category-defining companies — from Flipkart and Udaan to Tata Digital and xto10x — go from zero to high-scale with strong P&L ownership and cross-functional leadership. At xto10x, I lead Academy Programs that help high-intent startups move from product-market fit to IPO readiness through structured interventions, deep operating work, and international expansion — including xto10x’s entry into Saudi/MENA. Previously, I was Chief Business Officer at Tata Digital, where I helped scale the Tata Neu super-app across grocery, health, fashion, and jewelry. As a founding team member at Udaan, I built and led the Food (Staples/FMCG) business from scratch to a $1B+ GMV run rate, and later led innovation in offline retail and quick commerce. At Flipkart, I spent ~4 years in leadership roles across category, business finance, and supply chain — helping shape the early infrastructure of Indian e-commerce. I began my career at P&G and J&J, managing large-format trade, launching national shopper marketing programs, and building out the trade marketing function for JJVC India.",

      "Abhishek B V “Tanveer's one of the brightest spots at Flipkart. I consider myself lucky for having had the opportunity of closely working with him over the last few months. In my opinion, his ability to connect the dots & end to end thinking has been second to none. He's someone who is able to look beyond the obvious and unlock opportunities hitherto unknown. He is one of the most self-assured persons i've come across. And another thing that stands out in Tanveer is his selfless attitude & his willingness to support projects and initiatives beyond his usual domain. In addition to strong design thinking mindset, he packs a solid punch on the analytics front as well. eKart's supply chain network is powered by one of the extensive models built by Tanveer. Tanveer's destined for great things & wishing him the very best!”"

    "about": "In my career straddling business as well as people roles, I have seen how organisations with the right strategy run by well-intentioned founders can get stuck because they didn't get their org set-up right. I am passionate about solving such problems. My role at xto10x focuses on working deeply with companies to align people priorities with business outcomes - taking the form of engagements varying from org design to leadership assessment & development to people systems design. Over the past few years, my interest in Applied Psychology deepened and led me to pursue training. Today, as a Professional Coach, I draw from the schools of Transactional Analysis and Psychodrama to help me work with founders, stakeholders and my teams. (Not to mention, in my personal sphere too!) Outside of work, I am known for my rather dry PJs and rather decent music skills. Having been a part of music bands since school, I became adept at playing the keys. Over the last few years, I have worked on my singing and occasionally perform for shows and record.",

Rahul has 3 strong elements of a good leader 1) High empathy 2 ) Strong analytical skills with good first principle thinking 3) A High level of Integrity, he has also a good sense of humor but that's WIP As a senior leader in our business, we always felt we could trust Rahul and he was instrumental in helping us navigate the effects of Covid -19 within the business and to deliver the company message across a very large team. Rahul has a strong sense of ownership and the ability to drive a team towards a goal but his most impressive quality is to get everyone on the table to like and respect him.”",
      "Amitha RKM “Rahul is an empathetic leader, who helped shape the culture at our organisation in a big way. This set in motion a multitude of cascading events that helped foster a high-performance culture across the organisation. I reported directly to Rahul for 3 years, a tenure during which I have seen Rahul encourage authenticity within the team and foster a strong sense of camaraderie, allowing the true potential of his democratic leadership style to drive change and impact. As a Manager, he trusted me to drive high impact projects, ones I was truly passionate about, with as much creative flexibility and onus as he did with others - with the bigger picture in mind. This also helped set the right operating pace for the team, one that aligned with the organisation’s fast pace of growth. His ability to strategically manoeuvre complex challenges helped us navigate the transition from an early-phase to a high-growth startup, with a fortitude that I drew tremendous inspiration from. He encouraged the cultivation of a culture of humour at the workplace, one that impacted the build of stronger relationships and definitely made work fun while we were at it. I have had a lot to learn through this opportunity of working with Rahul and I couldn’t be more confident that it will be for any individual, team or organisation that he works with in the future.”"

      "Vivekananda Hallekere “Neeraj is one of the best ops experts I have met. He has been extremely helpful in our journey at Bounce. He is always approachable, understands the details, down to earth, very effective in communicating and also a great leader. We are lucky to have met him and get his time for Bounce. I would highly recommend anyone starting up in an op heavy business to talk to Neeraj. ”",
      "Arnab Chakraborty “You get the opportunity to work in Flipkart kind of organization, very rarely, the icing on the cake was to have Neeraj as the Boss. With his ability to go deep into the subject, amazing analytical skill, trust in the team, and above all humility, made him our friend, philosopher, and guide more than a Boss. I fondly recall those days of working together on new implementations like BYOD (Mobile for Delivery Executives), Hub Layout, Van Delivery, Early Morning Deliveries, and many others, which were new experiments at that time in eCommerce, but became standard practice for the industry. Proud to have him as a friend and mentor to this day. All the very best for your role at Xto10X. I am sure this will be another feather in your cap.”"

A seasoned talent professional, he knows EVERYTHING there is no know about getting and retaining talent!”",

His high emotional intelligence and ability to identify strengths and areas of development of his team members made him a great leader. Praveen gave me autonomy and showed confidence that helped me grow professionally under his guidance. Praveen's patience and calmness, even in high-pressure situations, is an admirable quality. His in-depth knowledge of the recruitment field is undoubtedly impeccable. Praveen is an excellent manager, a friend, a mentor, and a great HR professional to work with. I wish him the best in his future endeavors. ”"

When one of our largest, most complex customers requested on-site technical assistance in preparation for go-live, we flew Vjay over to the United States from India. The trip was an unqualified success. The customer was very satisfied and we were able to enhance the product based on recommendations that Vjay brought back.”"

He's able to structure his thoughts really well and lay down a solid fundamental framework to build from. Arya's also detail oriented and ensures that the right level of zoom-in is done. Alongside being excellent at work, he has a passion for interests like rock climbing & sketching that make him so well rounded. You can always bet on Arya to give his best to the cause & step back. Operates with a maturity and thought process that's years ahead of his age and is poised for great heights. Enjoyed working with him on some tough, exciting problem statements at Bounce. Wishing him the very best!”"

I started with a foundation in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, earned a Pharmacy degree, and then spent four years deeply immersed in UPSC preparation—gaining expertise in Polity, History, Economics, International Relations, Science & Tech, and Current Affairs. This experience not only expanded my knowledge but also sharpened my critical thinking, research, and problem-solving skills. Beyond academics, I have worked in content strategy, SEO, and stakeholder engagement. I have experience in website content development, editing, and SEO optimization, ensuring clarity, brand alignment, and enhanced visibility. Additionally, I have worked on user research, market analysis, and cross-functional coordination to drive strategic decisions. 🔹 What Drives Me? The joy of learning, meaningful conversations, and exploring new ideas. 🔹 What Excites Me? Philosophy, Psychology, Biographies, History, Geopolitics, Mental Health, and Contemporary Issues. With a strong foundation in communication, problem-solving, and adaptability, I thrive in dynamic environments that require analytical thinking and collaboration.

Additionally, I worked closely with the founders on high-impact initiatives to shape company strategy. At McKinsey, I led strategy projects across growth, org design, and cost optimization.

      "Deepak Pruthy “Sonali is the most hardworking person I have known till date, along with Modi ji of course! An astute planner who not only plans for herself but for her team and client as well. She sets very high standard of performance for her as well as the team. If client expected X, McKinsey leadership expected 1.2X; her benchmark was always 2X. I have always seen clients admiring her work ethic even in her absence. She always takes a holistic approach to building growth. The agility with which she used to switch from B2B2C to B2B to a branding workstream was praiseworthy. On a humane side, she is one of the finest individual I have come across. Sonali is a leader par excellence!”"

Welcome :) I'm driven by a curiosity surrounding what I can do to make people's personal and professional lives easier or more meaningful. My path (from consulting to edtech to founder development to entrepreneurship) has been shaped by this curiosity. Each step has taught me something valuable: how big companies transform even at their scales, how beautiful products grow, how founders learn and lead, and how to validate ideas directly with users. When I'm not working, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen, training my voice to sing well all the songs I sing badly anyway, or reading!",

Her eye for detail while deep diving into the requirements of clients was something that always impressed me in particular. Building a rapport with clients and candidates alike was another impressive trait. Goal oriented and hand on, she was an ever dependent colleague to work with. Wishing her all the very best.”",
      "Jitender Sharan “I took help from Dipika to close a critical role in my org recently. She diligently created a profile of the responsibilities from our briefs and created proposals on candidate fitment. She also kept up with our own vision changes in this process. I believe her candidate liaison was exceptional and allowed a very high quality first touch. Her ability to drive coveted candidates in a tough economic scenario was unmatched. We appreciated that she worked hard to master our pitch and deliver it with clarity. The discussions, interviews and the closure were all smooth and predictable. I highly recommend her and would definitely work with her again.”"
