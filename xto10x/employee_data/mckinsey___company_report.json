David is very encouraging and is very certain that the work has to be perfect and on time. I also like the way he looks at things for the future and also times at which the work doesnt happen perfectly he would expect his colleagues say 'we screwed up' and would help in getting things right. It was indeed a pleasure working under him and would like to work under him in future.”",
            "Nirmal Merchant “David's exceptional leadership abilities were evident in the very first opportunity I had to interact with him. He puts a group of talented individuals together, portrays a clear vision and then lets the team drive the implementation, occasionally directing the strategy of the project in reaction to emerging knowledge and intelligence. He also creates a very congenial environment for his team to have a frank and honest exchange of ideas and opinions and frequently challenges the team's assumptions to inject creativity and innovation. He is goal and delivery oriented with a keen eye on relationship management. He is passionate about his work and eager to learn more about other disciplines that can contribute towards achieving the goal of his function. It will always be a pleasure working with David.”"

Throught this time he has demonstrated professionalism and integrity in all aspects of his work, whether with internal staff or external (police) customers. I particularly value his ability to offer constructuve suggestions for progress and he is not afriad to disagree. One of Matt's key strengths is his commitment to the growth of his staff and regularly coaches and mentors his direct reports through regular \"Away Days\" and challenging them to share what they have learned with others. he is supportive, fostering talents of those around him Matt has earned the trust and respect of colleagues through responsiveness and accountability and contributed to year-on-year success of senior management team in growing national market share - all this whilst while completing Exec MBA over last 18 months.”",
            "Torsten Hoffmann “Matt and I have been studying together for 1.5 years now. I worked with him frequently on important group assignments. Matt has exceptional analytical, logical and mathematical skills - He would be the one who still understands a complex financial Excel model at 2 a.m. After a successful career in science where he also lectured and published, he gained international management experience for LGC. This rather unique background enables him to see the bigger picture that business people tend to miss. It is an honor to be working with him as Class Representative for the Business School and I have asked for his advise many times as he is a person I fully trust. I am more than happy to recommend Matt for future business purposes.”"

I am passionate about Veterans issues through helping non-profits support Veterans and making McKinsey more Veteran-friendly. I returned to McKinsey in 2018 after leading transformation efforts at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the US federal government's 2nd largest agency, from 2014-2018 serving in a variety of roles to include Chief Transformation Officer, Interim Deputy Secretary (COO) and Chief Information Officer. During my tenure at VA, Veteran trust in VA improved from 47% to now &gt;80% as VA focused on customer experience, improving access and timeliness of care and services, improving efficiency/effectiveness of operations, modernizing through technology (to include digital experience, Electronic Health Records, and technology infrastructure), improving the employee experience, and expanding strategic partnerships (with private sector, non-profits, Department of Defense, states, other government agencies and Veteran Service Organizations). I am a proud US Army Veteran and a dedicated advocate for our nation’s Veterans. I am a Scituate Massachusetts native, a sports fanatic (Boston, Cleveland and all things football), and father of 3 amazing children (2 hockey goalies and an Ice Dancer).",

The effectiveness of this period hinges on shifting rapidly from campaigning to planning the transition—two efforts with very different objectives and skill sets.

There are five crucial elements to get right in integrating the expanded post-election transition team."

As a strategy consultant, my goal is to guide my clients during their most critical moments, and to help them gain conviction behind the decisions that they need to make to be successful. I currently live in Boston and travel where my work leads me. Specialties: Corporate and Business Unit Strategy, Mergers and Acquisitions, Commercial Excellence and Organizational Culture",

Consulting at its best is a team sport in which the best outcomes -- both for the team and for clients -- result from individual players who are at the top of their game, and who are able to make one another better. That's the kind of player/coach Vijay is. What has struck me most -- beyond the credibility Vijay has established as a leading expert in the chemicals industry -- is the trust CEOs and other C-level executives have in him. I know from my own career experience that such a high level of trust must be earned, and built over many years. When we achieve a certain point and level in our careers, finding mentors from whom we can learn and continue to grow professionally becomes more challenging. Vijay has been a mentor to me and many others -- his insightful video on how consulting must be bought from trusted advisors, and practical guidance on how people at all levels can become one, is a seminal asset that should be required for all client-facing people at Accenture. I'm grateful for the opportunities Vijay has provided me to share and to learn and for the example he sets.”",

This allows the firm access to have meaningful conversations with client executives. He is also a Chemicals Industry expert and provides insights to the team to tailor offerings to clients. Finally he is a positive force within the Chemicals community and a good mentor and team member across the consulting ranks.”"

              "description": "Companies must take a more nuanced look at connectivity providers as the Internet of Things evolves.The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly, with 127 new devices connecting to the Internet every second. Although many new applications target consumers, including smart-home systems and connected cars, others help companies optimize operations ranging from manufacturing to customer segmentation. As IoT expands, companies’ connectivity expenditures will rise by about 15 percent annually through 2022. To capture this growth, connectivity providers will extend their coverage and investigate innovative technologies, including low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs).Such shifts could have major repercussions for companies that sell IoT devices or services. For many years, they relied on country leads to select connectivity providers, and the default choice was often the largest regional or local player. A few also asked systems integrators for provider recommendations, often with similar results. But as IoT becomes more important to the bottom line, companies must reassess their connectivity needs and make more nuanced decisions that consider global coverage, intelligent-switching capabilities, service delivery, pricing, security, and IoT expertise."

When we founded Electric Ocean in Cape Town, together with Nick Wittenberg, it was one of the first digital agencies of it's kind in the world; and that is characteristic of Quentin. Working alongside Quentin in building and training a team of 35 web developers, client execs, planners and designers was formative and he also made it fun.”",
            "Lance Larsen “Quentin's leadership in delivering highly valuable digital media experiences is now legend, so I won't belabor that at all. I wanted to recommend his passion... his ability to remain incredibly upbeat and positive even in the face of extreme hardship, and his ability to lead through positive example and by encouraging the heart of those in his midst. He is always paying keen attention to the needs of clients and others around him first, while also not losing sight of externally factors like markets, trends, innovation, and management techniques. He is one of the best people I have ever worked with, and consider the time we spent together at Razorfish one of the highlights of my career and an honor and privilege not soon forgotten.”"

I had the opportunity to work with him in our Database class and I was amaze with the dedication and hard work he put into our project. Despite of his busy schedule from work to being a Rawls Ambassador, he never failed to contribute in each deliverable. He is highly an organized individual, communicative, helpful, detailed oriented and a great leader. I am glad I am working with him again for another project because I know it will be a successful one. Stephon is an active student and achieved so much with his past internships, work experience and school work. I believe he will be a great IT leader in the future and a strong asset to any company.”"

I know quite a bit about business, Asia, New York City, and economics; my knowledge of early 20th century baseball is embarrassingly profound (see link on left). Generally, I can get interested in almost anything, and am a quick study. I have a full-time job, but am interested in project work. In the last year, for example, I have edited one book on accounting standards in Japan, which was not the most fascinating topic, and another on the future of the solar industry, which was genuinely interesting. I also wrote a report for a private-equity group and a feature article for Inc. magazine.",

In those two years, I’ve seen her not only excel at her primary duties of supervising the MWL hall desk, which serves over 1,200 residents but, learn and excel in other duties such as advising and emergency response. I was particularly impressed with Jennifer’s abilities to step in to assist the Department of Residence in the role of “residence hall director,” when I was unable to fulfill my duties due to a family emergency. Any employer would be fortunate to have Jennifer on their team. ”"

During my 20 years in numerous roles across McKinsey's People function, I have built and overseen an integrated team. This team has direct responsibility for recruiting, professional development, evaluations and reviews, learning, and human resources. I partner globally to design our firm's regional People strategy, shaping our employee value proposition and experience. This includes building a robust diversity and inclusion strategy and fostering a stronger culture of development. I am deeply committed to leveraging GenAI advancements within our organization, applying innovative solutions to enhance our approach to various HR initiatives including performance reviews. Every day, I am dedicated to building a remarkable firm that attracts, develops, excites, and retains exceptional people. Prior to my People roles, I was a McKinsey consultant serving clients on various strategic topics with a focus on marketing and sales in the consumer and retail industries. I have an MBA from Harvard Business School and a BS in Accounting from Miami University. I live in Atlanta, GA, with my husband Matt and our three children. Outside of work, I'm an active tennis player, runner, enthusiastic cook, and avid traveler.",

          "about": "I serve on several private company and not-for-profit boards, as an investor in several early stage companies, and as a coach to some of the many senior leaders that I've had the privilege to work with over the years. I am also a faculty member for McKinsey's Executive Transition Masterclass, a program for new CxOs, BU leaders, and equivalent that aims to help executives realize their and their organization's full potential in those key periods. As a Senior Partner in McKinsey & Company’s San Francisco office, I worked extensively with financial services, technology, telecommunications, retail and hospitality firms on an array of strategy, organization, operations, marketing, sales, and data and technology-enablement opportunities. For McKinsey, I played various roles in our firm's Growth Marketing & Sales Practice over the years. These included creating and leading the Digital Marketing Practice and leading the overall Practice for the Americas. I have deep expertise in applying data, analytics, and technology to drive more profitable customer experience management, customer loyalty and retention, consumer and shopper insights. I’ve written numerous articles on the evolution of customer loyalty programs, e-commerce, marketing analytics, and other topics in publications such as the McKinsey Quarterly, Harvard Business Review, CRM Magazine, and Forbes. Additionally, I co-authored the book \"Net Worth: Shaping Markets When Customers Make the Rules\" with John Hagel.",

            "John Murabito “I felt like Kristen would be right for Cigna’s open CMO position the moment I met her. She has a great balance of successful line operating responsibility and transformational, growth focused CMO experience. Her humility and authenticity are attractive qualities for a senior leader and I was drawn to that and to her varied experience. Kristen joined Cigna during the first month of the global pandemic knowing only 10 of 75,000 employees. In her first six months, Kristen launched initiatives that directly impacted society – including the Brave of Heart Fund. Over 18 months, she developed a highly diverse, high-performing team that digitally launched a breakthrough health services brand, Evernorth, representing a significant growth engine for the company. Kristen's leadership and experience are well suited for the challenges we must tackle in the world ahead.”",
            "Eric Martinez “First, Kristen was my client. Then, she was my boss. She was an amazing advocate and partner in crime in both relationships. As a client, she gives the best briefs. Big and ambitious. With the potential for transformative impact. As a boss, she's open and collaborative, and has a deep well of trust for her team. Kristen is an ambitious leader who's whip smart and fun. And I've been able to do some of the best, most transformative work in my career while working with her.”"

Megha naturally emerged as the team project manager and led our team to success by demonstrating professionalism, organization, tact, and inclusion. She is a pleasure to work with and a great collaborator. If the opportunity ever presented itself for me to work with Megha again, I would not hesitate to join her team or recommend her as a candidate for any leadership role.”",

During this time Megha was working within the engineering team focusing on Escalation Engineering support for UIM “Unified infrastructure manager” Megha took on the challenge of supporting a brand new product and did a fantastic job. Megha was the primary contact person for both customer problems and questions from the EMC presales teams. During the two years that Megha worked for EMC, Megha increased not only her technical skills, but she also expanded her interpersonal skills as she interacted with customers and EMC employees. I would recommend Megha as a quality employee and would hire her back tomorrow if the opportunity came. Regards, Kenneth Andersen EMC”"

There is a pressing need to do more, and most organizations realize this: company commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high for the third year in a row.Despite this commitment, progress continues to be too slow—and may even be stalling. One of the most powerful reasons for this is a simple one: we have blind spots when it comes to diversity, and we can’t solve problems that we don’t see or understand clearly.Women in the Workplace 2017 is a comprehensive study of the state of women in corporate America. This research is part of a long-term partnership between LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Company to give organizations the information they need to promote women’s leadership and foster gender equality."

              "description": "Contributing Author. To preserve the memory of their service during the tumultuous decade since their commissioning as Army officers, members of the West Point class of 2004 have written The Strong Gray Line. This class suffered the highest casualty rate since those that graduated during the Vietnam War. In this book, thirteen of their classmates who lost their lives fighting the Global War on Terror are profiled to help the reader gain an understanding of the bond forged between classmates during time at West Point, a bond that transcends the separation of death.In addition to the stirring profiles, thirteen personal essays detail some of the most brutal fighting of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in addition to the struggles endured by those on the home front. These stories range from visceral observations of combat to a wife’s anxious wait for her husband to return home. Holistically, these stories define an emotional spectrum that enables the reader to connect not only with the experience of the Class of 2004, but with every man and woman who served their country in a time of war."

          "about": "I am a Senior Partner with McKinsey & Company and lead our Global Health Insurance Practice and Center for US Healthcare Improvement, as well as previously our Center for US Health System Reform. Over the past three decades, I have worked with many of the leading health insurers, providers, large employers, and health agencies. I counsel client CEOs, top teams, and Boards on both strategy development as well as transformation programs, including future operating model definition, organization re-design, capability building, cost restructuring, M&A integration, and Board restructuring. I am passionate about making high quality health care affordable for everyone in America, particularly the least well off, and led the launch of our Medicaid Practice. My publications have focused on growth opportunities in Medicaid, the impact of big data in health care, high performance provider networks, and US health care costs. I have served as a keynote speaker with over a hundred companies as well as industry forums including AHIP, BCBSA, National Governors Association, NIHCM, and Health Datapalooza. Within McKinsey, I am an enthusiastic advocate for advancing the careers of our women professionals. I have served as Global Dean of Inclusive Learning, faculty for our Women’s Pathway to Partner program, and built gender balanced teams to serve the clients I help advise. In recognition of my impact in helping our women colleagues realize their professional aspirations, I was chosen by McKinsey’s women Partners and Senior Partners to receive one of the Firm’s highest honors, the Lowell Bryan Award. Within the Firm, I have also helped Chair our Global Partner Review Committee and currently am a member of Echelon, a small group of Senior Partners selected by our Global Managing Partner to help introduce and scale new clients, as well as on McKinsey’s Special Initiative on CEO Counseling. Outside the Firm, I am a passionate supporter of the arts and serve on the Advisory Board of the New York Metropolitan Opera (underwrote The Enchanted Island) and Chair the Executive Committee of the Manhattan School of Music. My wife, Francoise Girard, and I also helped launch Maestro William Christie’s baroque opera festival with Les Arts Florissants and the Juilliard School. Prior to joining McKinsey, I completed a Ph.D. and Master's in Political Philosophy from Oxford University as well as a B.A. Honours degree in Canada from Queen's University. I live in Manhattan and Montreal.",

I had the absolute pleasure of working with Saurabh for the last three years at Deloitte and Trialscope on many projects. Saurabh helped me learn and grow as a developer by inspiring me to ask questions and dig deeper. He provided me with projects that both matched and challenged my abilities. Saurabh also encouraged nontechnical intellectual conversation, a well rounded highlight of our afternoon breaks and would often bring in snacks to boost team morale. He is the go to person when something is past deadline and needs to be done as quickly as possible. The depth and breadth of his knowledge are nonpareil in software engineering.”",

He is focused, dedicated and takes ownership in every task assigned. Very reliable as a manager and has a kind personality. Definitely one of the best managers I have worked for. He is also extremely hardworking with great people management and leadership skills. The quote “The difference between boss and a leader; a boss says ‘Go!' - leader says 'Let’s go!'\" is truly applicable to Saurabh. ”"

            "Satya Bhan “Mailchimp has been my first deep dive into front end development. I started working with Sarah right from the start, iterating on designs, providing engineering feedback to streamline development. It has been such a joy to work with her. She has a keen eye for details and really listening and incorporating the feedback into her designs. I especially recall a meeting where we were brainstorming a UX experience and spitballing ideas and by the end of the meeting she already had a full blown figma design ready. I love how she can take abstract concepts we are discussing and bring them to life. I also really appreciate how proactive Sarah is about her communication. In case of any clarifications or ambiguity she is great at setting up quick meetings to resolve discussions and provide clearly labeled designs to the team. And she has an awesome fun bubbly personality. I've absolutely loved working with her :)”",
            "Ricky Knight “I worked with Sarah at Mailchimp and she is an incredibly talented designer and a pleasure to work with. She's always professional and thoughtful, never letting the customer experience be compromised. She works end to end: from inception, to research, to iteration, to rationalizing work to org leaders, it's all in her wheelhouse. Her work ethic is contagious and she's a natural leader who maintains deep empathy for her peers. I always came to her for questions or just to get ideas on how to level up my work. I'm glad I got the chance to work with her and would be stoked to ever work with her again.”"

He is an expert in knowing how best to communicate to his audience and inspire them to action with his storytelling and video production.”",

          "about": "I am an experienced lawyer who takes a “whole brain” approach to solve complex legal problems. On one side, I am infinitely curious. I love to figure out how things work. And not necessarily machines or other physical objects, but things like money laundering, feudalism, static electricity, and the Rule 5 draft. I wasn’t necessarily the kid who took everything apart growing up, but I was certainly the kid who often fell asleep with a stack of encyclopedias beside the bed. The “related articles” section always led to another trip to the bookshelf. Wikipedia makes this a much lighter lift these days. On the other side, I am highly analytical and practical. I love breaking down a problem, argument, or goal its component parts then figuring out which of those parts truly matter and which are just noise. I also have a passion for numbers, and spreadsheets are a guilty pleasure of mine. I find it strangely gratifying to create a tricked-out spreadsheet and watch the cascading change in values when one cell is updated. This total brain approach has served me well in my legal career. Truly solving a legal problem requires not only that you analyze the law, but also that you do a deep dive into the surrounding circumstances, such as the client’s industry and business goals. You must frame the problem, and therefore the solution, in the context of those circumstances and goals. The most brilliant solution is worthless if it is not practical and executable. Few legal questions have a single definitive answer. Rather, the answer is what is right for a particular client, given the balance of business goals and potential risk. On the personal side, I grew up in a small town with a local dirt track, which led to a life-long love of auto racing and other forms of live entertainment, especially sports and music. There is nothing quick like the collective response to a clutch home run or an epic performance. I also enjoy playing video games and the piano. I’m not terribly good at either, but I don’t let a lack of talent get in the way of doing something I enjoy!",

I am looking forward to exploring bike trails in the area and finding quiet spots to kayak. I am an HR Generalist with 2+ years of HR experience, most recently for Survival Systems USA in Connecticut. I love helping people by answering their questions or working with them through an issue they may be having. I also enjoy working with data and would like to become more involved with HRIS systems so that I could combine my HR experience with my IT background. I have enjoyed Project Coordinator or Data Analyst positions in the past. My project management experience has been an asset for all of the positions I have held as it has enabled me to organize my work as well as work with people at all levels within a company. My love of reading and learning have also been big contributors to my sucess in all of the positions I have held in the past because once I decide to take on a position, I read everything I can find to learn as much as I can. I am a fast learner and love to learn new things by jumping in with both feet.",

            "LinkedIn User “In all my career, few co-workers have impressed me as much as Ryan Kelly. In our time working together, I saw him take over a very intricate department, lead two critical teams in a Product Owner capacity, and work across several vendors and sister brands to deliver the data our company needed, all while serving as a liaison to the organization, successfully conveying the very complex work that our teams do. Few can balance being both a fearless leader and an incredibly kind and encouraging one, working with team members daily to make sure they are empowered to deliver and that their voices were heard. Ryan was a great partner in delivering on our roadmaps and was an all-around joy to work with. I could not recommend someone more. ”",
            "Koushik Biswas “Ryan struck me as a passionate hands-on Technology Leader excelling in aligning and motivating his team into delivering results. His technical depth helps establish a common lingo with architects and engineers, earning their respect and accelerating delivery. His crisp communication and stakeholder management skills have cleared many hurdles for me and my team. Ryan's willingness to roll up the sleeves and lead by example is well-complemented by his strategic focus. I have seen him exercise context over control more easily than many other leaders, trusting and empowering the right people to remove blockers and gain velocity without compromising quality. I would love to work with him again!”"

He has a rare ability to lead calmly and strategically, while fostering a collaborative and empowering team culture. Niz models clarity in problem-solving and balances it with empathy and integrity. He also took the time to invest in my development, offering actionable feedback and carving out opportunities for me to grow.”",
            "John Thephasdin, MBA, CFA “There are not many like Nizam I have encountered in my career in financial services. He is a truly unique individual with a fantastic skillset, and a great friend and confidant. Throughout the ~2 years I spent working alongside “Niz,” he quickly brought me up to speed on how the Firm operates and how Finalta fits into the McKinsey architecture. Outside of his extensive knowledge base, he is a great connector of people and resources, always looking for the most effective and efficient solution to problems. This is what truly sets him apart from others – his ability to take the really complex and boil it down to something simple for coworkers and clients. I will miss working with Niz.”"

We were staffed together on an engagement for a multi-national corporation that was restructuring its operations around the globe. Ingrid was an incredible Engagement Manager. Our clients trusted her completely, because the impact she had on the success of the initiatives was undeniable. She is incredibly intelligent, hardworking, and finds solutions to even the most complex problems. As a manager, she strikes the perfect balance between being supportive, and showing trust in her team. Ingrid is not only easy to work with, she is a joy to be around!”",
            "Allan Jaenicke “Spend 5 minutes with Ingrid and you will know she is special. Underneath her happy, bubbly appearance is an exceedingly talented individual. Her ability to connect with people is second-to-none. Her thoroughness and dedication to the work she does is incredible. Her loyalty is admirable, but the loyal followership she develops wherever she goes is simply amazing. Ingrid will change the world, not just because she is talented, but because she is persistent and able to build 'an army' of followers that will take on her cause. A true leader.”"

In our line of business, problems are not always apparent, and timely solutions are paramount. Scott is the type of colleague one can always rely on to dig into an issue and be confident that he will find the root and an efficient solution to the problem in a timely fashion. We trusted Scott and his superb skills to aid in research and resolutions of these issues. Scott would be, with no place to doubt, a most valuable asset to any organization and I would gladly welcome the opportunity to work with him again.”",

Within his first month at GreenSky, he brought together colleagues from Technology, Analytics, Sales and Operations who had never worked so closely together and pulled off a very successful integrated direct response campaign. He’s also excellent at managing people and truly cares about their well-being and career progression. He’s quick to recognize accomplishments and challenge his employees with additional responsibilities. I would highly recommend him for any executive role that requires creative problem solving, ambition and collaboration. ”",

            "Ruben Derderian “It is my distinct pleasure to recommend Wenyi (Wendy) Zhu. I have known Wendy and have enjoyed her friendship and support for almost two years. In my role as Director of International Acceleration at the Houston Technology Center (HTC), I work with a number of organizations in China and have benefited greatly from Wendy’s counsel and support. I have engaged Wendy in several complex business proposals to Chinese organizations and have solicited her involvement and support in many meetings and presentations. Her knowledge of the Chinese language, thought process, and culture and her ability to explain them to me in an understandable way has been a great asset. She has a high energy level coupled with a calming and engaging manor and quickly gains the respect and confidence of everyone she meets. Her thought process is very analytical and logical which helps her quickly grasp complex concepts and she has the ability explain they in a very non-technical understandable manor. One of my responsibilities at HTC is that of creating the curriculum for and teaching the basics of entrepreneurship to new HTC client companies. Wendy is always eager to learn and has volunteered her time and support to assist whenever she can. Because of her eagerness to learn more about the principles of business and how to help new businesses get started on the right path she studied the curriculum and volunteered to mentor several of HTC’s start-up companies. Although her educational focus and background are technical, she has an uncanny ability to understand the concepts of business and express them in a straight forward and clear manner. Many of HTC’s start-up companies have benefited from her mentoring and counsel. Wendy has the energy, ambition, and ability to succeed and she will be a great asset to any organization she becomes associated with. Ruben Derderian ”"

            "Amanda Russell, MBA “Some people talk about changing the game,,,,or the world,.,then there are those who go out there and do it -Greg is one of those people. Greg's brilliance makes him an automatic leader, but it's his humility, integrity, ability to constantly think bigger, go beyond the status quo, to push the boundaries and innovate that makes him an absolute legend. Greg isn't just a friend and colleague, he has become a trusted advisor, mentor and the first person I find myself seeking advice from when it comes to business and my career in academia. Greg, your generosity with your time, your mind, and resources inspire me to reach a little higher, and I am so honored to call you a colleague and friend.”",
            "Alan Catello Grazioso “Greg is an inspiring instructor and colleague. I was a grad student in his Digital Media and Advertising Strategy course at Harvard (MGMT E-6650) in 2019 and the experience was hands, practical, engaging and awe-inspiring. Greg is incredibly smart, warm, graceful, a clear communicator, and very passionate about all things online marketing. His strategic advice and real-world questions and insights have changed how I see online media and marketing. Greg's willingness to have 1:1 conversations and mentor students makes him stand out as a favorite faculty member among students. I consider Greg a trusted advisor and I foresee ample future collaboration opportunities. Therefore, I highly recommend that you collaborate with Greg (or take one of his classes).”"

I have realised that, while there's a lot I can do to serve others, I can more sustainably and meaningfully effect change by leveraging my skills and knowledge to increase the ease in which a large group of people can care for a community. I've always been attracted to healthcare. I started my windy path to healthcare with my high school volunteer days at a local hospital, found myself working as an emergency medical respondent in college, and explored my interest in the clinical field through my degree in chemistry. Though I decided that my passion was not in direct care or research, I held to my desire to positively influence the lives of others. Over the past few years, I've been immersed in the realm of transforming primary care through my work at One Medical Group. I'm honoured to be able to continue to assist in driving forward the company's mission to deliver high quality care affordably. From my role directly interacting with patients through my growth into operational design and execution, I have had the joy of being able to watch the impact this organisation has on thousands of lives every day through patient-centred primary care powered by technology.",

He is a great coach on strategy and team leadership, being able to always ask the right question and structure the problem in logical and leanest way possible. Cole has an impressive ability to pass a complex key message in simple and appealing manner, which was crucial for driving growth in service line he was managing. As a part of the conference team Cole was leading, I can say that he is a great leader and facilitator as he did a great job of getting the team on the same page and keeping the enthusiasm and focus in the team. He is also a great conversation buddy, being very purposeful and possessing an immense intellectual capacity and curiosity. I enjoyed working with Cole and would be glad to work with him again. I have no doubt that he would be a great contribution to any team, and would strongly recommend him.”",

          "about": "My purpose and intentions are to combine my God-given gifts of teaching, organization, encouragement, faith, writing, editing and leadership in a useful and productive way in a corporate environment. My current job at McKinsey & Company allows me to put all of my skills to work in a global environment, which is very exciting. Teaching piano is a one-on-one relationship that I thoroughly enjoy, and I have the privilege of passing along my years of musical experience while using my skills in teaching, although I maintain a very small number of students. My work at the Bradenton Executive Center centered on my writing, editing and teaching skills, and I had the privilege of working in a Godly environment with a team of women who shared my desire to overlap business and ministry and serve others. My editing/writing jobs were a creative outlet for me and I thoroughly enjoyed taking someone else's material and making it shine with professionalism, cohesiveness and eloquence--I now do that at McKinsey!. My greatest joy, however, was my own company--Simplify. This company gave me the opportunity to coach, teach, and organize others while encouraging them. It is a passion of mine to teach others how to efficiently run their home or office, and I loved the freedoms that result for each client from the fruit of our work together. I enjoyed my last few years with my own company and the variety and flexibility that it provided; but I am thoroughly enjoying the corporate environment these days and the unique challenges that this brings to my table.",

I had written 2 manuals and several website bios as well as edited countless contracts, documents, correspondence, and marketing material.  This re-awakened in me the desire to have my own proofreading service, and I  began some side consulting in this area.  I have edited a friend's e-book for publication, have reviewed policies and procedures documents as well as several websites, and have created an interactive table of contents.  I enjoyed the process of taking a document that is well-written by someone who knows their subject, but doesn't know how to present it professionally.  I also enjoyed organizing words, sentences and paragraphs into a semblance of order and coherence.  For those business people who can't put words on paper, I enjoyed the process of gathering information and creating/writing a comprehensive document for them.  Overall, I simply like to both write and edit, in almost any form.  My vision for this particular branch of my self-employment was to offer the opportunity to other businesses to look and sound professional through my own contributions of cleaning up and scrubbing all documents, correspondence and online presence materials.  I believe that my education in marketing/business, my experience in office management and executive assistance, and my writing/editing abilities created a robust niche that allowed me to be able to offer a valuable service to businesses that struggled with a professional presence.",

It ran for 14 weeks [7 meetings, every other week] every spring and every fall. The purpose of the group was to teach women how to manage the resources and time that God has given them in a manner that is pleasing to Him and that creates efficiencies and freedoms. The classes covered the philosophy of getting organized, setting our priorities, avoiding procrastination, persevering, goalsetting, managing paperwork, controlling our calendars, decluttering our spaces, managing our cleaning schedules, menu planning, organizing recipes, creating effective to-do lists, creating efficient grocery lists, maintaining efficient kitchen spaces, and organizing our holiday planning. Every subject finds its foundation in Biblical values and we started and ended each session with a devotional and prayer. Our ultimate goal was to find time each day to spend with God so that He can give us the wisdom and strength to organize the rest of our time and spaces. I provided the tools to get the practical side of life organized and running smoothly. My end goal was always to encourage the class members to pursue God, and as Proverbs 9:10 says, He will make the hours of our day more productive and the years of our life more fruitful. Show less",

              "description": "The purpose of this paper is to estimate individual promotional campaign impacts through Bayesian inference. Conventional statistics have worked well for analyzing the impact of direct marketing promotions on purchase behavior. However, many modern marketing programs must drive multiple purchase objectives, requiring more precise arbitration between multiple offers and collection of more data with which to differentiate individuals. This often results in datasets that are highly dimensional, yet also sparse, straining the power of statistical methods to properly estimate the effect of promotional treatments. The findings of this work focus on comparing a machine-learned Bayesian approach with linear regression (which is representative of the current state of practice among industry practitioners) in the analysis of a promotional campaign across three key areas: highly dimensional data, sparse data and likelihood matching. The original contribution is the application of machine-learning to Bayesian Belief Network construction in the context of analyzing a multi-channel promotional campaign’s impact on individual customers."

In one embodiment the collapsible support structure is part of a railcar, which includes a missile-engaging guidance and/or support structure, a rail engaging element, and a hinged pantograph-like collapsible support extending between the missile-engaging structure and the rail engaging element. A hinge of the pantograph is locked in a storage state and during part of motion during the missile launch. The hinge is unlocked, and travel of the rail engaging element is stopped. The missile-engaging support structure momentarily continues its motion, and the pantograph collapses. Capture elements engage parts of the railcar or the canister during collapse to prevent rebound of the missile-engaging support structure toward the missile."

The field of analytics has developed rapidly since the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) released its landmark 2011 report, Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity. But much value remains on the table as organizations wrestle with issues of strategy and implementation. In this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, MGI partner Michael Chui and McKinsey senior partner Nicolaus Henke speak with McKinsey Publishing’s Simon London about the changing landscape for data and analytics, opportunities in industries from retail to healthcare, and implications for workers."

Within each category, we discuss the sectors and occupations where robots and other machines are most—and least—likely to serve as substitutes in activities humans currently perform. Toward the end of this article, we discuss how evolving technologies, such as natural-language generation, could change the outlook, as well as some implications for senior executives who lead increasingly automated enterprises."

The most important insight has been that it is far more useful to think about the activities that can be automated rather than entire occupations—handing over discrete bits to machines, like pulling out the most useful data from an analyst’s report, generating a report on the latest sales figures, or moving products around a warehouse."

In what follows, we identify three sets of opportunities: expanding pools of value in global B2B markets, new levers of operational excellence, and possibilities for innovative business models. In parallel, executives will need to deal with three sets of challenges: organizational misalignment, technological interoperability and analytics hurdles, and heightened cybersecurity risks."

In this research, the McKinsey Global Institute set out to look beyond the hype to understand exactly how IoT technology can create real economic value. Our central finding is that the hype may actually understate the full potential of the Internet of Things—but that capturing the maximum benefits will require an understanding of where real value can be created and successfully addressing a set of systems issues, including interoperability."

            "Peter Petralia, PhD (He/Him) “Justin is an absolute pleasure to work with. He has the right balance of listening to the needs of the team, understanding the needs of the client, and figuring out how to ensure that a good culture is maintained when problems arise. He thinks ahead, plans thoroughly, and (importantly) cares about the work and team. He regularly put in long hours working on a complex account without complaint, and knew when to set boundaries to ensure sanity. He was proactive with suggesting process improvements and could lead work independently with no supervision. In short, he is a PM I trust to know what to do, when, how, and with the right attitude. ”"

            "Max Venables “I stated working with Ruchi as a young and relatively inexperienced consultant for a small training and development company in PA. When Ruchi joined the team, I knew I was in good hands. Ruchi's work ethic, which accompanied her natural smarts and ability to lead, quickly motivated me to set and reach my goals within the organization. Culture changed as a result of Ruchi's management styles and energetic personality. After just a few days of working with Ruchi, I felt as though I'd been reporting to her for years. Ruchi's interpersonal and communication skills are just a few of the many characteristics that made her a great manager. I am confident that with Ruchi's intelligence, work ethic, motivated personality, and willingness to help others will add value to whoever she works with and wherever she works!”",

She really embraced our culture and in turn had the ability to quickly adapt to our fast paced environment while still producing quality work. Her thought process was clear and never skipped a beat in asking questions.. the RIGHT questions. She was thoughtful & strategic in developing Operations Training content to ensure optimal efficiency and relevance for the end user. All stakeholders were part of the process and accountable. ”"
