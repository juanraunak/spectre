Every subsequent interaction with him since- including the podcast experience has been nothing short of extra-ordinary and illuminating- Raghu is sharp, well-read with persausive, crystallized points of view yet curious to hear divergent perspectives and rethink, technically deep while having a solid understanding of business and commercial aspects. In particular, he comes with super strong AI chops wearing many hats as AI practioner, blogger, author, speaker and evangelist. Above all, Raghu is a kind, compassionate and emphathic colleague who exemplies SAP's values to make SAP better for generations to come. I highly recommend Raghu for leadership roles in AI.‚Äù",

            "Alexandre ROS ‚ÄúI have had the pleasure of working in Matthias' organization for the past six years. Throughout our interactions, his leadership, strategic thinking and people management skills were key to meet the ever-transforming expectations of SAP and our customers. Two aspects of his leadership come to mind: First, his mastery of strengthening ties with customers in times of turmoil to successfully support their data-driven digital transformation. Second, his capacity to listen to his people and bridge the gap between their expectations and the organization's needs. Underlying both aspects is his knowledgeable vow to improve sustainable business, one step at a time, by rethinking processes without neglecting his goals and direct reports. Both a servant and strategic leader through and through.‚Äù",
            "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, Matthias is an absolute leader when it comes to inspiring young people to take on a sustainable way of living and spreading ways of how to do so. I was very fortunate to meet Matthias during my last semester in university. The class was about building a digital, social enterprise, together with the support of mentors from SAP. After pitching our business, a digital procurement platform for ‚ÄúUnverpackt‚Äù (zero waste) stores, we found a perfect match with our mentor Matthias. With his help and expert guidance on the topic of sustainability, we managed to set the conceptual foundation of our venture and also were able to pitch our business to an expert jury ‚Äì landing first place in the competition. Without Matthias, this would not have been possible. Beyond this class, Matthias continued to mentor me in my professional life, which I am very thankful for. I would 100% recommend to everybody who gets the chance to work for Matthias, since he is a great role model and leader.‚Äù"

            "Grant Coleman ‚ÄúJose is one of most natural born people leaders I have ever had the opportunity to watch at work. We were peers running different regions at SAP, and I saw Jose drive a complete 180 degree pivot of the regions performance to become the highest growing region inside just 6 months. But, the important things come when you understand why Jose is able to drive these outcomes. He was firstly able to find the right strategic approach to unlock potential in the business, but secondly (and this is where the real secret sauce is for me), he was able to communicate and drive these strategies better than anyone I have ever seen. When Jose tells you how why, when and with who, you absolutely believe it can be done and will be achieved. He can break through multiple personalities using humour and credibility to earn the trust of his teams and audiences. He is never focused on just how Sales and Success are going to get it done, rather, he understands the value in galvanising all teams and departments to march toward the same goal - a huge benefit of his very varied and multi departmental experience. One of the very best, I am sure I will work for him one day!‚Äù",
            "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúJose joined the EMEA business at a critical point in our transformation year with a mandate to reenergise the region and ensure our growth plans were achieved. I've worked with some great leaders in my career but can confidently say that none have matched Jose for energy, drive and a focus on making teams successful. Within days of joining the business he had identified the key issues that required attention and then set about addressing them - which resulted in earning trust from his teams and a renewed focus on executing. Jose sets high standards for his teams, but not unreasonably so, with an objective of getting the best out of people and helping them to develop. I definitely developed my own skillsets and capabilities under his leadership and am without doubt better equipped to run my own teams as a result. With his focus on speed of execution, the culture was fast paced, a lot of fun, and a can-do attitude prevailed. On a personal level, we developed a great friendship over the time we worked together - he's a family man and he takes the time to get to know his teams personally. One day, I look forward to working for, or with him, again.‚Äù"

            "Junaid Ahmed ‚ÄúWalter was one of the best managers I have had in my career. Walter keeps everyone honest by being data driven and uses a strong sense of customer focus in driving priorities within his and partner teams. Managing engineers with different skills, personalities and backgrounds comes very naturally to him. Being a very hard working engineer himself, he sets a good precedence for his team. While most engineering managers are solely focused on technical matters, Walter adds versatility by being a genuine mentor and a good friend; this leads to great personal rapport with all his colleagues. Walter could be counted on in any engineering environment to make the best use of his team and deliver great overall results.‚Äù"

He challenged my creativity in ways I never thought possible, and in some way, encouraging me to take the route towards thought-leadership. Storytelling, digital note-taking, effective use of social media, personal and corporate branding... all these I learned from James and who knows what he could still have taught me. A captivating storyteller, James's effect is transcendent, that much I can say.‚Äù",

I have had the pleasure of working and learning from James in my first months of onboarding at SAP Ariba.

At the empowement workshop she walked us through her personal journey of growth and learning, and then gave us the tools and supported us in practice to become more confident and better public speakers. The combination of demonstration and break out practice sessions helped everybody in the room to grow, and Vivien supported everybody personally, one by one, by watching us try out the new techniques she'd taught us, and providing us live helpful, supportive feedback for us to try out straight away. Vivien is kind, friendly and easily approchable which makes her ideal for this kind of training, and it put us all at ease. Also watching how confident and capable she is at presenting gave us a live view into \"how it's done\" by a professional. I cannot recommend Vivien or this course enough, and can't wait to see her grow this area over the coming days, weeks, months and years.‚Äù",
            "Glen Thompson ‚ÄúVivien is one of the most dedicated, passionate and accountable people I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Working alongside her for 13 months whilst on my placement year at SAP UKI has taught me much, most notably how to manage multiple projects simultaneously. A great role model and team player, Vivien inspires all around her with her exuberance and creative thinking, and I hope our paths cross again soon.‚Äù"

            "Scott S. ‚ÄúContent at SAPPHIRE NOW is the reason to attend, must be relevant to the target audiences, and directly impacts the business results. \"Global Content Strategy Lead\" fails to do justice to the true challenge Kathleen faced, or the accomplishments achieved. It can be hard to put into words how someone performed when their actions have actually set the standard to which you are comparing. Kathleen is not \"better than\", \"stronger than\", or \"like other in that ...\", she IS the standard for content management at the SAPPHIRE NOW programs. But why? Kathleen brought pose, intelligence, coordination, understanding, sympathy, political awareness, product knowledge, consensus building, objective based decisions, and an open ear to the process of leading a cross organizational team, each with their own areas of focus. And, she repeated this for several SAPPHIRE NOW events in different regions. In addition to the process management, she showed the business awareness of how the content would fit into the balance of the event, other marketing activities, and the corporate objectives. To all, she became invaluable and irreplaceable.‚Äù"

            "Steve Kurzman ‚ÄúJen is not only an extremely effective leader, she‚Äôs a force of nature. I had the pleasure of working with her at TripIt, including as a direct report, and a few things stood out. She built a culture of trust and collaboration within the Product teams ‚Äî and with Engineering ‚Äî based on user-centeredness. ‚ÄúTripiteers‚Äù were really devoted to making travel less stressful for our users. Sometimes we disagreed about how exactly to do that, but we were always willing to work together to solve problems for those users. This enabled our teams to listen to everyone, work well together and accomplish a tremendous amount despite frequently being understaffed and stretched thin. Jen is also adept at translating high-level executive goals from the usual gobbledegook into terms meaningful to individual contributors. Sadly, a rare skill. Her ability to clearly communicate high-level strategy to us meant we were well aligned and empowered to work quickly and independently with a shared vision. Jen got us on the same page and we got stuff done. Finally, Jen actually listens to her reports and invites everyone to speak up, contribute ideas and offer constructive critique. I always felt this had a multiplier effect: if your manager values your input, you tend to care more and follow their lead, which resulted in a strong culture at TripIt. I would happily work for her again.‚Äù",
            "Dave Navarro McDonald ‚ÄúFirst, everybody should be so lucky to work with Jen. She not only is an amazing product professional, but she is a stellar people manager. She enables people to do their best work. I was lucky to work for her while on the TripIt UX team. She is not a designer by trade, but that doesn't make her any less impactful as a UX leader. Jen is able to get consensus in a room full of opinionated designers. That's not an easy task. One of her greatest strengths is getting a diverse group of people together to get things done! Jen is one of the smartest, most insightful people I know. I'm always impressed with her ability to take in complex information and pose thoughtful, curious questions to get to the heart of an issue. She is discerning in her approach to everything that she does. This makes her the sharpest person in the room. You always want to know what Jen thinks about a topic. Trust me. My time working for Jen was the best experience. She leveled up my idea of what a people manager should be. I learned so much from her, and treasure our 1:1s where we talked about work, strategy, and any fun stories we had. I know I'll have made the right career choices if I get to work for Jen again in the future. I'm looking forward to it.‚Äù"

            "Peter Struckmeyer ‚ÄúLloyd served as an important mentor for me during my time working within SAP's Utilities practice. He is a dependable leader whose relationship-oriented approach to management guided our team to repeated success. Lloyd's ability to empathize with customers is unmatched. He is one of the most qualified leaders I have ever met, and he was influential in my career growth as an early talent at SAP.‚Äù",
            "Charles Ferguson (ÊñπËá£Ê±â), GAICD ‚ÄúLloyd personifies the qualities required to be a truly great people manager: VISION - VALUES - VERVE : Vision in that he gripped the future and communicated clearly to the team; Values in that he provided the team a unifying code of practice that supported and enhanced co-operation; Verve in that he always came to us with positive enthusiasm knowing its the best way of making the work exciting and fun. If you do not think your work is exciting, then we have found a problem, and Lloyd saw to solving that everyday. A better word than Verve might be Chutzpah (except that it does not begin with a \"V\") which means \"shameless audacity\". Is that not refreshing? Inspiring even? Lloyd dared to do what he decided to do and did it with confidence and pride. It was simply a wonderful experience working for him.‚Äù"

              "description": "The continued success of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative artificial intelligence approaches highlights the advantages that large information corpora can have over rigidly defined symbolic models, but also serves as a proof-point of the challenges that purely statistics-based approaches have in terms of safety and trustworthiness. As a framework for contextualizing the potential, as well as the limitations of LLMs and other foundation model-based technologies, we propose the concept of a Large Process Model (LPM) that combines the correlation power of LLMs with the analytical precision and reliability of knowledge-based systems and automated reasoning approaches. LPMs are envisioned to directly utilize the wealth of process management experience that experts have accumulated, as well as process performance data of organizations with diverse characteristics, e.g., regarding size, region, or industry. In this vision, the proposed LPM would enable organizations to receive context-specific (tailored) process and other business models, analytical deep-dives, and improvement recommendations. As such, it would allow to substantially decrease the time and effort required for business transformation, while also allowing for deeper, more impactful, and more actionable insights than previously possible. We argue that implementing an LPM is feasible, but also highlight limitations and research challenges that need to be solved to implement particular aspects of the LPM vision."

He has an intense energy which he brings to everything he does; he is a living example of being constantly open to learning, learning fast, and applying immediately. Anyone who works with him has a superb role model to follow. He genuinely and sincerely cares about the growth of the people on his teams. That level of energy and integrity can move mountains.‚Äù",
            "Peter Moore ‚ÄúI have had the honour to work with Paul Marriott for my entire career at SAP to date since first joining in 2013. Paul was running the Database business for APJ at the time and I was inspired by his passion, technical depth of knowledge and ability to inspire our customers and colleagues. Since then I have continued to operate in multiple roles that have had the benefit of Paul's leadership with my most recent promotion to GM of Platform & Technologies for APJ reporting directly in to Paul. I am extremely excited to witness the impact that Paul's has already made to the SAP APJ region as President and can't wait to see what the future brings. I know I want to continue to be a part of this journey. ‚Äù"

He develops and motivates his team, takes and manages risks, establishes trust and lasting relationships, and delivers exceptional results to his clients and for his firm. If I had to choose a single executive to lead or transform my company, it would be Todd Crandall. By way of background - My interactions with Todd span 20 Years. Todd has reported to me. I have reported to him. We have worked shoulder to shoulder to deliver complex commercial and technical results. We have been competitors representing rival consulting firms serving the same client / market segment, and we worked together as executives leading segments of a complex multi-billion dollar services company. ‚Äù",
            "Andrew Jornod ‚ÄúI joined HCL to work directly for Todd in 2011. His leadership and mentorship throughout that time, combined with the experience and success we achieved together, significantly impacted and shaped my own professional career. Todd‚Äôs ability to find a creative approach to challenging circumstances was proven as HCL‚Äôs business grew significantly under his leadership. His ability to engage with the internal business operations and facing off with the customers is highly effective and impressive to experience.‚Äù"

            "Ruth Zamudio ‚ÄúI worked with Martin at SAP University Alliances (UA). During this time, I could see that Martin has a deep understanding of the academic community and is capable of highly strategic thinking - building a strong business case to support their needs based on rational analysis and sector knowledge. The UK&I community not only drove innovation, but also shared their knowledge and led as an example to the global SAP UA community. I believe this is direct result of Martin‚Äôs leadership. I find Martin very knowledgeable on SAP strategy, an excellent communicator and well organized. I also had the opportunity to interact with the working students under Martin's charge, and I could see that Martin sets a great professional example to junior colleagues. Even though we were located in different cities Martin was reachable when needed, supported new global initiatives when rolled out and provided feedback on the local demands. It has been a pleasure working with him.‚Äù",

Probably the best compliment that I can give him is, \"...he is the BEST sales and biz dev person that I have ever met!\" Scott possesses an exceptional business prowess, strong analytical skills and a direct communication style. He understands how to manage processes and has a knack for aligning people, which allows him to get things done. All-in-all, Scott's personality and skills lend themselves to building a client's confidence in him and the product or service that he represents. Ultimately, this is why he is a great sales person. The bottom line, I would re-hire Scott in a second. Taking this one step further, I would I hire him to run a sales organization. My confidence in him and his ability to generate success is unwavering. -Jim Zordani, VP- Ceridian, HRO‚Äù"

            "Roshni Thawani, M.I. ‚ÄúSophia is one of the most thoughtful and motivated mentors I‚Äôve ever had. Throughout the course of my 16 month internship with IBM, she dedicated time to teaching me tactical skills on storytelling, public speaking, organization, and personal branding with eminence. Further, I had the chance to co-collaborate with her on initiatives for women empowerment throughout the sustainability software organization. Sophia always showed up with great enthusiasm, a personable connection, and an actionable strategy to get the job done. I admire the care that compliments her ambition, which shows in how much she thinks of her team throughout the organization. She‚Äôs very respectful, and always brought the right balance of personable and professionalism to each and every one of our conversations. I wholeheartedly appreciate the time and guidance she‚Äôs given. She consistently puts forth her full effort into all initiatives she takes part in, she embraces her role with passion, and keeps large audiences at ease. I would greatly recommend her in numerous leadership roles, as I know she would add a tremendous impact to any team, organization, or an individual contributors journey.‚Äù",
            "Jackson Hong ‚ÄúSophia is one of the biggest reasons the project I worked on managed to be released. Not only did she do everything in her power to push the project forward, she also contributed to the visual design and UX/UI of the project. Sophia's impact will not be forgotten.‚Äù"

To do that, we work with our customers to understand where the industry needs to improve. Then we analyze the overall SAP portfolio of solutions to find the ones that best serve those needs. Where solutions don't exist or don't fit the industry need, we work with our internal development team and partners to enhance existing solutions or to develop new solutions on our Business Technology Platform. I believe that, in the industries my team supports, we can literally build a better, more sustainable world and I want to help make that a reality. My approach is informed by my extensive experience in the industry. I've worked as a President, District Manager, Program Manager, Senior Project Manager, Project Manager and Project Engineer in the commercial construction and real estate sectors. In my free time I still enjoy getting my hands dirty with construction projects. A few years ago; my brother-in-law, my daughter, and I built a house for my daughter and her family. With the exception of a few trades that we don't enjoy (concrete, brick, & roofing) we did all the work ourselves.",

            "Marc Villeneuve ‚ÄúDan is one of the most tenacious and dedicated people I know. As a direct leader, and now a mentor, he continues to be incredibly supportive and obsessive in helping others grow and succeed. He is always willing to lend a hand, give an opinion, or edit an email or job application. As a salesperson, I have not met anyone as hard-working, compassionate or relentless as Dan. He taught me the value of doing deep research, understanding your product and value inside-out, and being prepared at all times. I could not have asked for someone better to start my sales career with and, like it or not, will continue to lean on Dan as I progress through my own career.‚Äù",
            "Dan Petz ‚ÄúIt's hard to sum up the impact Dan has had on my early sales career in just a few sentences. When I first started Dan worked closely with me through thick and thin to develop my skills and became a major factor in my success. His leadership qualities are exceptional, his emotional intelligence is unmatched and his potential is limitless. He was the kind of guy you could go to with any question or problem, whether it be work-related or in your personal life, he was always there. Dan is also extremely intelligent and competent and brought value to every situation - if he didn't have a solution, he went out and found one. Not many are lucky enough to have had such a great boss, one who genuinely makes you excited to come to work every day and proud to work for. Even after leaving our team, Dan will be someone I turn to for advice and I look forward to remaining close in the years to come. Thank you for all that you've done Dan, I really appreciate it man. Always remember to name your price!‚Äù"

            "Ian Chamberland ‚ÄúI was lucky enough to work with Spencer at IntelyCare for a little over a year and I can say with confidence he is one of the best people I have ever had the privilege of working with. Spencer has an unparalleled ability to connect with people, from the building maintenance staff all the way up the C-Suite. He is able to communicate \"at their level\" and can adjust his communication tactics to meet the audience where they are. Not once did I ever hear \"won't\" or \"can't\" - no matter the problem, Spencer will do whatever it takes to find a solution that works for all parties involved and won't stop until he finds it. Adept at leveraging the different tools and resources available to him, I can't count the number of innovative solutions he came up with that helped IntelyCare capitalize on new opportunities, improve KPIs, or just \"be there\" for someone when they needed a pick-me up. Spencer is the kind of person you want to work with day in and day out. Between his quantitative skills, his natural selling skills, and ability to connect with people, anyone lucky enough to be in Spencer's orbit stands to be a better person after having known him. I'm incredibly thankful for everything he did at IntelyCare - if you're lucky enough to have him on your team, you won't be disappointed.‚Äù",
            "Jeff Hymas ‚ÄúI can't say enough good things about the job Spencer did as our summer marketing intern at Savage. From his positive attitude, dedicated work ethic, and always going above and beyond what was asked, we were very fortunate to have Spencer as a part of our team. He made a big difference in a short amount of time, helping us with projects in website SEO, new office openings, market research, and much more. Spencer would be a fantastic addition to any team that's looking to grow and wants to hire someone who will contribute to a positive company culture and help achieve business success. ‚Äù"

Over the past two years, Jeff has dedicated countless hours to my development and growth. From shadowing his calls to setting up role plays for me to practice. Jeff has been committed to helping me transition smoothly into a customer success role from my early talent program. Jeff not only provided valuable advice but also equipped me with the skills to navigate difficult situations independently. He has the ability to identify areas for improvement and create effective strategies to address them. What truly sets Jeff apart as a leader and mentor is his unwavering dedication to supporting others.‚Äù",

            "Raj Nathan ‚ÄúI have known Irfan for fifteen years and he reported to me directly for twelve of those years beginning as a first level manager and eventually rising to take the role as the first CTO of the company. Over the years that he worked for me, I increasingly relied on him and delegated more and more of tasks that dealt with evangelism, product definition and technical interactions with customers. He is very sound technically and has great ideas and clarity in technical product strategy and direction. Further he is very proficient in articulating his ideas with clarity. It is this ability coupled with his technical skills that made him a favorite of customers. He would quickly understand the customer‚Äôs problems and suggest options that are appropriate for that specific customer. Through the years my confidence in him rose steadily. This confidence in him was not just because of his skills, but more importantly founded on his soundness of character, attitude to work and company and quality work output. I would without hesitation rank him among the top 5% of employees I have had in my three plus decades in the industry.‚Äù",

He is also a loyal and trustworthy team player, always goes the extra miles. I know customers love talking to him . Very fortunate to have him on my team.‚Äù"

              "description": "When historians look back on the years 2007 to 2009, they will call this period \"The Age of Risk Negligence.\" Major capital market firms had smart systems in place through which market data flowed and it was all managed by smart men and women who oversaw their firm's risk exposure. Despite these sober systems, the source of the global financial breakdown was not in the risk technology or the people in charge of the systems, but in the people who ignored the warnings. Risk practices went out the window as firms chased profits with reckless abandon.How do we avoid this risk calamity in the future? The New Data Imperative: Managing Real-Time Risk in Capital Markets is a start. Written by Dr. Raj Nathan, Irfan Khan and Sinan Baskan, this book is a clear-eyed roadmap for building a reinforced data enterprise that will help fortify today's ambitious investment firms."

            "Mohan Kumar K ‚ÄúCini is Gem of a kind! I was reporting to her couple of years ago and I‚Äôve never felt that she was my boss at any time. She is a very good manager who have always supported her colleagues. She was good not just in managing people but also in many other team activities. She used to understand our short term goals and long term goals and used to guide us to the direction. I always have thought about one thing and I have even asked her too as in being a manager, mother for 2 kids and a team member how does she possibly manage to stay ahead, consistently outperform and win team awards every year. Well that doesn't look to me as a secret but the way you prioritize and manage your work life. That is perfect example for me from a person who sets such a fantastic example to the team and rest of our community. I had very good working experience with Cini as my Manager, Mentor and a friend.‚Äù",
            "Ujwal Jetagi ‚ÄúI had fun filled working experience with Cini.Being project manager she had very good understanding of project content and timeline which made her create very good project plan considering all aspects of projects. She had very good functional background in healthcare industry which made her plan each development item at granular level. Daily quick check during test phase made team to resolve issues quickly and provide better result on Q-goal.Overall it was a great experience working with Cini.‚Äù"

            "Andres Botero ‚ÄúFor many years I worked with Richard at SAP and for a couple of years I reported directly to him. Overall we worked together for about 10 years. Richard is one of the most knowledgeable people around in the Supply Chain Management space, period. He has a lot of domain expertise and is able to quickly assess the strategic and tactical implications of new developments in the space. Richard is a fantastic communicator and one of the sharpest pens I have ran across. His blog series and tweets have made him into a powerful influencer in the enterprise SCM area. He is a no non-sense manager and has a fantastic sense of humor. He is able to easily build bridges to Analysts and other key influencers as his approachable and demeanor makes it impossible not to like him. As a manager Richard inspired me to give my best to the company and the role. He removed obstacles blocking my pathway, he supported me when I needed it, he encourage me and push me when it made sense. The years I reported to Richard were very productive and fulfilling for me in great part because of his hands-on, trusting style and his constant coaching and advise. Richard's teams have always been recognized as high performing and their impact has gone well beyond its size. Richard is a go- getter and highly productive. Either working on a tele campaign, collateral, analyst interaction, blog, analysis or keynote presentation, every minute invested with him advanced the project and got us close to our goal. SAP is lucky to have Richard in its ranks as his productivity and impact in SCM are huge. And I am grateful for the opportunity to work with and for him and learning a lot in the process.‚Äù",
            "Colin Masson ‚ÄúIt was a pleasure to work with Richard during my tenure at Marcam and Invensys. Having 'done his time' in product development, project implementation and the product management of ERP for the process industries, Richard was well respected by both his subordinates and his peers. Richard brings energy, enthusiasm, credibility and executable vision to any Marketing team. His people management skills, and presentation skills are also worthy of a special mention.‚Äù"

            "Mike O'Neil ‚ÄúAs an SAP Partner Sales Manager who reported to me, Beth displayed all the qualities you look for in a sales professional. She is an assertive, well-organized leader who pushes her partners to excel and exceed their go-to-market objectives. As a senior professional on the team, Beth shared her best practices and acted as a mentor to the group. She consistently surpassed her sales objectives and was recognized by both SAP peers and the broader partner community as a problem solver who removed roadblocks and obstacles to success. Beth displays excellent communication skills and is very persuasive. I highly recommend Beth as a senior partner sales professional.‚Äù",
            "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúI wish Beth was on my team right now. I spent 5 years on the same team with Beth at SAP where together with Shane Corr, we managed the SAP Business One Channel in the United States. Working on the same team with Beth was one of the best experiences of my career. When I was on Beth's team, she consistently blew away her quota every quarter..... I personally watched that happen for 5 years straight. Since Beth is extremely competitive, it drove the rest of the team to also overachieve. Beth built a solid business in her region that continues to grow in many ways. Beth is passionate about the success of her business, and more importantly the success of her partners and her teammates. The comradery that our team had would be hard to replicate. On top of it all, our team had a lot of fun together and I built a great friendship with Beth. If I could build a team of the best people I have ever worked with, Beth would be on it.‚Äù"

            "Ryan Soltis ‚ÄúI highly recommend and greatly appreciated working for Shane. In addition to leading our entire organization as COO, Shane was also my direct manager. He had the vision and foresight to start a volume focused cloud-only sales team to connect with our customers in a previously untouched space. While the initial vision was his, he enabled me to take that vision and make it a reality as the leader of the sales team. His mentorship, guidance, and support enabled me to be extremely successful in the inaugural year of this team. As a leader, he has the unique ability to define high expectations while providing trust in his team to execute in a way that aligns with their best strengths. I look forward to the opportunity of working with and for Shane in the future.‚Äù",
            "William Cerniuk ‚ÄúUnofficially Shane was a part of my VA Mobile team and has been (and continues to be) a true asset to the operation. Shane provided critical time and mission relationship management to ensure the success of our operation and worked shoulder to shoulder with my staff and I to make our program fruitful. A highly intelligent leader, Shane pulled resources together and encouraged volunteer participation from a variety of sources inside not only Apple but within the VA; bringing people together for the benefit of our VA Mobile mission and ultimately our nation's Veterans. Shane does not sell product to his customers, Shane sells success, and in doing so engenders trust and respect amongst his clients. It has been and continues to be a pleasure to work with Shane.‚Äù"

Chad is consistently positive and enthusiastic on SAP engagements, seeing unresolved issues as opportunities for dialog and resolution. He has an outstanding ability to work directly with clients to extract the true business requirement. A natural problem-solver, Chad works independently yet is not afraid to approach management with an issue (usually with suggested resolutions). He extends his work outside his area of functional expertise where required and is eager to learn additional SAP functional knowledge, as well as managerial or 'soft' skills that will benefit his own career for years to come.

            "‚ÄúIn my opinion Babu has one of the most difficult jobs in the development organizations - he manages the Query Optimizer. The main difficulty comes from the fact that any change in the optimizer will make some queries faster while others slower. This is the fact of life the Optimizer group has to live with. I think Babu has a great talent in selecting the right set of fixes and projects making the Optimizer better and keeping the customers happy. Babu has a rare skill of dealing with customers. He does not blindly submit to every customers' desire without making sure that it will be inline with the group's vision, yet can still be very crafty in making them happy with possibly an alternative solution. Babu is not only a great manager but he is also an excellent engineer. He knows the code and the architecture like no one else. There isn't a single project that completes without his input. One of the best experiences for me working in Babu's group was a special team spirit that he created and maintained. It is not very obvious to the people outside of the group and it is not something people inside will talk about, but when you are in you know that you have the support of your piers trying to achieve the same goal for the best interest of the Optimizer component. On the personal side Babu is a very pleasant person. Working with him was very easy for me from day one. I felt like I have known him for years. Hopefully one day our roads will cross again and we'll get to work on the same project. I had a lot fun working in the Optimizer group in large due to the atmosphere created by Babu.‚Äù Show less"

            "‚ÄúI have been fortunate enough to work with Jack at several points over the last seven years at SAP, first in the EIM COE and later in the management of our database and data management business. From day one, Jack brought high energy, positive intensity and a can-do spirit that has helped our business grow continually. He is the ‚Äòking of common sense‚Äô and always pushes the extended matrix to simplify and improve execution of GTM initiatives. He‚Äôs very creative in his approach but avoids the impractical. And he‚Äôs very convincing- with a laugh and a joke he will make his point in a friendly way and get the extended team to see the issue he is addressing and (nine times out of ten) embrace his approach. His network is remarkable - he knows ‚Äòeverybody‚Äô, inside and outside the immediate business, and is widely respected. (When you walk down the halls of our headquarters with Jack, expect to spend an extra 15 minutes in impromptu conversations along the way). Very sorry to see him leave SAP, but I am sure he will be an immense asset to other organizations.‚Äù Show less"

Derived measurements are linked to base measurements in measurement chains. Events that are related causally may be linked together in event chains. The measurement chains and event chains may be used to generate subledger journal entries, which may in turn be used to generate general ledger journal entries.

Rick is the main reason that I came to work at SAP in 2005. I met Rick in my interview but had heard many positive things about him. Indeed, he came through when he wowed me with his knowledge and his desire to assist. In working with Rick over the next 8 years, I found him to be such an incredible individual who really cared for your success. He mentored me and imparted all of his knowledge to me freely and without restraint. I watch Rick grow in his career and I was very happy for his success. I see him continue to flourish and it does go to show that good things happen to good people. Rick, I'm looking forward to seeing you reach those next heights and continue to succeed with your authentic and caring self.‚Äù",

I've had the pleasure of managing and mentoring Colin for the past two years at SAP NS2 as a Project Controller. Colin is a highly coachable individual, detail oriented and very well organized. He was able to handle multiple projects and tasks under time pressure and always gets the job done. On top of his normal tasks, he would always offer a helping hand to his peers if anyone is in need of assistance. He is well liked by all the people that he supported and his colleagues due to his friendly demeanor and professionalism. I would highly recommend Colin, no matter what or how hard the task is, he'll get the job done! ‚Äù",

            "Derek Chan ‚ÄúI first came into Concur reporting to Bill and after transitioning teams was still able to work closely with him on a number of projects and tasks while at Concur. As a manager, I valued his ability to establish touch points with his reports and how he would always honor 1-on-1 meeting commitments. He valued the development of his team and recognizing accomplishment any chance he could. I appreciated his candid feedback both when asked or when he recognized a chance to offer constructive criticism. He has a great ability to keep the bigger picture in mind and acquire additional resources or help when needed (and in a very timely fashion). He is also one of the funniest guys I have ever worked with and it was a joy for him to have that duality of driving for results while cracking jokes and keeping things light along the way. It'd be a joy to work with Bill again!‚Äù",
            "Nic Tomei ‚ÄúI've had the privilege of working alongside Bill for several years now. Bill is the kind of leader everyone wants to work for and are lucky to work for if given the opportunity. He is positive, encouraging, highly intelligent, motivating, witty, and fun to be around. He makes the dull days more interesting and the hard days less taxing. He's also very tall - which is great if you need help getting manuals down off high shelves in the office, or hanging decorations for office celebrations. I hope to continue work next to Bill for many years to come. ‚Äù"

In 2006, Matt was assigned to our account as we were struggling with the implementation of previously purchased software, and we were not happy. Matt immediately met with us and took note of our experiences and concerns. Matt escalated issues for us and brought attention and resources to resolve them. In doing so, Matt made commitments to us and kept them. It wasn‚Äôt glamorous work, and it‚Äôs uncommon to see an Account Manager devoted to post-Sales service like this. Matt‚Äôs involvement helped us get through the implementation which is currently serving hundreds of internal users and external customers. Thanks for all your help Matt!‚Äù",

I am currently engaged in weaving the product strategy for Cloud ERP. Bringing a 360-degree perspective to the product, building it into the strategy and steering strategic projects, communicating the strategy in a simple and bi-directional manner and guiding it to a meaningful execution with our dear customers and partners, enabling cross-organizational teams across sales, marketing and Product Management, my day is an E2E vista of the product and its value from strategy to execution. With great enthusiasm for everything around end-to-end product management and novel training concepts, I am on a journey of discovering the subtle nuances in product management, adding the flavor of ‚Äòempathy‚Äô and ‚Äòemotional intelligence‚Äô to every single aspect and stage of the product. Every product, process or project indeed revolves around ‚Äòpeople‚Äô and every product innovation and leadership should emanate that value. In parallel, I am a creative writer, choreographer and trainer in performing arts experimenting new concepts in dance as a therapy.",

            "Doug Eisengrein, CLSS ‚ÄúI was interviewed and hired, and then directly managed by Lori for about 6 months in 2009 at Unisfair, a small Silicon Valley SaaS startup. During that period, I experienced on a daily basis Lori's adept management skill and technical acumen, as well as her direct-but-friendly professional demeanor. Her ability to lead a diverse Operations team in a highly technical, fast-changing environment - particularly during extremely busy times with non-negotiable client deadlines - was a master class in efficient project execution, professionalism, and employee support. Right in the middle of the company's busiest quarter, I had an unexpected family emergency - and Lori's support was unwavering. Upon returning to the office a few weeks later, I saw and heard how my substantial workload was rapidly re-assigned and load-balanced, keeping mission-critical client services moving straight ahead. I would gladly recommend Lori for her senior technical management aptitude, as well as her warm yet \"firm when it matters\" personality.‚Äù",
            "Kara Shields ‚ÄúI was extremely lucky to work with Lori as a consultant on one of her projects. Lori is easily one of the most organized and driven project managers I've worked with but has no trouble bending her style to accommodate even the pickiest of customers. Her clients were consistently impressed by her prep work as well as the way she ran implementations in a fun and effective way. As a consultant working with Lori, she was great about checking in to see if I needed support on my tasks, but was also happy to step back and let me handle things when my expertise was needed. I was very grateful for her balance of management and trust. Lori would be an asset to any team! ‚Äù"

We worked together on many projects to improve data visibility and streamline the sharing of competitive information. He is extremely hardworking and always positive. He will go out of his way to give you his best work and make you smile while he does it. He understands deadlines and will put in the extra hours when need be. From day 1 he is able to both add value and add to the culture. Henry is truly a special person and will be a tremendous addition to any team! ‚Äù",
            "Rachel Pokorney ‚ÄúHenry has one of the highest characters of any young person I know! I got to watch him as a camp counselor for our student org, Camp Kesem, and the attention he gave to each child and the connections he formed were off the charts. He is incredibly thoughtful and selfless not only towards friends and family, but also to people like security guards and janitors (whom he got to know by name and blesses with gifts). He is someone with the highest integrity, venting to me once about his disapproval for coworkers using their phones during company hours, and vowing to never do that. Someone who gets those small details right will undoubtedly be trusted with the bigger issues as well. Your company would be lucky to have him!‚Äù"

When he became my boss, our relationship continued to grow and he became a mentor for me. I always knew he would provide advice when given and it was usually a different lens than my own. I appreciated his openness and honesty and trustworthiness. I always knew if I asked a hard question, he would tell me the truth and give me constructive feedback. I sought out Chris when I wanted to return to the workforce and he hired me back. He provided me challenging roles and promoted me to leading the operations center. He always provided great mentorship and a friend as well. ‚Äù",
            "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúI had opportunities to work with Chris in 3 different teams within Microsoft, in different roles over the course of last 8-10 years. And every time, it has been a great learning experience. I have seen him evolve and grow and take greater responsibilities and excel in the same. As a leader, he has always been structured, consistent, composed, very detail oriented yet empowering his team members, open to suggestions and feedback. Chris consistently put the org's, partner's and team's goals on priority and is an awesome partner to work with. He is a great mix of technical acumen, process and project management, people skills and business strategic thinking. I have learnt a lot by just observing him, by my direct and indirect interactions with him and by his mentoring and guidance. He is someone, who is a great asset, an awesome leader and trusted advisor for any organization and team. ‚Äù"

          "about": "If I had to choose one phrase to describe my professional career it would be twist of fate; an unanticipated change in a sequence of events. I was supposed to be a mechanical engineer and I loved everything about the prospects of this career path! The math, the problem solving, the technology and most importantly‚Ä¶the cars (because I am a total gearhead). A twist of fate (and a need to fund my college tuition) brought me to the metals industry. This was supposed to be a quick pit stop on the road to my engineering destiny. Then two years later 9/11 happened and no one was hiring engineers. Well then, metals industry I guess I am here to stay! Fast forward six years and another twist of fate opened up a door to a role in IT. A very unlikely choice for me personally but the prospect of trying something new and unknown was very attractive at the time. Fast forward sixteen more years and I cannot imagine not being in IT. Participating in seven SAP ECC implementations for 1,800 users, traveling the world to collaborate with colleagues and solving complex problems daily pretty much guarantees no day is like the one before. As my role has evolved to senior leadership I have had the opportunity to build a world class SAP Center of Excellence with my cohort, foster the professional growth of team members and founded a DEI group for women in STEM. I am particularly proud of these DEI groups, as I have had the pleasure of participating in several other local and global women‚Äôs groups and it has been very rewarding to see individuals blossom when supported by others who provide a safe space, recognize potential, understand the challenges you face and believe in you even when you do always not believe in yourself. Seeing others grow to their full potential has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my professional career. Sometimes I do not even know what my actual role is. If you need a beacon of hope, a rock to lean on, to talk to someone who will listen or who sees you as your true self give me a call. Perhaps this is what fate had in store for me all along.",

As the head of our engineering department at both organizations, Michael directly managed all of our technical resources. Since Milo's business was centered on these engineers, Michael's role was strategically significant. At Voxeo, he continued to manage these same individuals while overseeing their seamless integration into Voxeo's existing team. In both roles, Michael worked closely with the rest of the management team to identify, hone, and promote our suite of products and services. I found Michael to be a sound strategic thinker, an extremely capable operational leader, a tireless worker, a true corporate diplomat, and a gifted technologist with a solid grasp of business fundamentals. Most important, he is a trustworthy professional who earns the respect of all his colleagues.‚Äù",

Milo was a software engineering professional services company focused on Java based Internet software, and ultimately became the leader in the newly emerged VoiceXML language. Michael helped build and oversee a team of about twenty engineers. During that time, he had extensive interaction with clients. He proved to be highly reliable, delivering numerous projects on-time. He communicated very well with clients, as well as with other employees at Milo. His technical skills are top-notch. I highly recommend Michael.‚Äù"

            "Mercedes Oz ‚ÄúI had the privilege of working alongside Brian during a pivotal time at SAP, where his leadership left a lasting impression not just on outcomes, but on people. As peers reporting into the same leader, I saw firsthand how he approached his work‚Äîand his team‚Äîwith a rare combination of compassion, clarity, and conviction. Brian is deeply respected and genuinely loved by his team, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. He leads with heart. He creates an environment where people feel supported, heard, and empowered to grow. He‚Äôs the kind of leader who celebrates individual aspirations, shields his team from unnecessary noise, and ensures they have what they need to succeed‚Äînot just in their roles, but in their careers. Beyond his own team, Brian is a model of cross-functional collaboration. He builds bridges across departments, listens generously, and brings people together to solve tough challenges. His presence in a room elevates the dialogue and creates trust. He‚Äôs more than a supportive peer‚Äîhe‚Äôs a true partner. Thoughtful, principled, and always focused on what‚Äôs best for the business and the people. I would work with him again without hesitation.‚Äù",
            "Jeff Gerace ‚ÄúFew people have the opportunity to report to a manger who is also a great mentor and development coach. I was lucky enough to have this opportunity when I worked for Brian. Brian has personally contributed to my development on multiple levels from increasing my skillset as a digital marketer deriving insights and recommendations based off analytics, innovation of new ideas and tactics, and overall personal development. Brian is a manager who has the skillset and knowledge that you trust as an employee and he isn‚Äôt afraid to roll up his sleeves to contribute to the success of the team. Any employee would be lucky enough to have Brian as a Manager and any team would be lucky to have Brian in a leadership role. I can‚Äôt say enough of how Brian has helped my development personally and I would highly recommend him based off his leadership, skills, coaching, and track record of success. ‚Äù"

Since that time, she earned my respect by being a trusted member of the organization, a hard worker, committed to learning and bettering herself. She has a reputation as being a ‚Äúteam-player\", she treats her co-workers like family and her customers like friends. She is competitive but does not have a \"win at all costs\" attitude. She balances her work life by being an incredible mother, wife a \"friend to many\" and someone everybody enjoys being around. I would highly recommend Audrey.‚Äù",

            "Tyler Vandervort ‚ÄúAlyssa truly has been one of the best managers that I have had the experience of reporting to. She is focused on creating a great team dynamic with wonderful motivational skills that usher her reps to success. She exemplifies purpose-driven decision making and cuts out a lot of the noise that one can receive while working at a large corporation creating a positive work experience. What was noticeable right away was Alyssa‚Äôs effort to know her employees; not only their professional goals but their personal goals as well helping her match her employees‚Äô strengths to their work. I fully endorse Alyssa for any management position for not only her drive and commitment to succeed but also since she is a joy to work with and her ability generate a upbeat atmosphere that is constructive and encourages success.‚Äù"

            "Luke Gleadall, MEd ‚ÄúI had the huge pleasure of working with Dave during my time at SAP Concur. During that time, Dave constantly impressed me. There are many talents for me to cover but possibly one of my favorites is his wonderful knack of getting to the heart of the problem through asking the most pertinent questions and doing so with a genuine curiosity. An astute thinker and a visionary, he added incredible value with his insight into many projects. He is gifted with both an eye for detail and a strategic vision that leads small to big projects. Through his work, he has boosted the team and the organization with incredible influence. On top of all this, he builds relationships across the organization easily and is a joy to work with. I am beyond grateful that I had the opportunity to work alongside him and learn from him in so many ways.‚Äù",
            "Laurel Schulert ‚ÄúFor the past 5 years, Dave has been my thought partner in leading the Learning Experience team at SAP Concur. Dave is a visionary thinker, and also brings a keen business acumen and an action-oriented attitude. Dave skilfully led transformative projects for us, such as the rollout of agile project management to our department, and he also played an integral role in defining and launching our new project management tool and project intake process. Dave also partnered with me to co-present sessions at the DevLearn and Association for Talent Development (ATD) conferences, and co-authored a job aid in an ATD publication. Dave has a remarkable ability to bring both \"out of the box\" thinking and a \"can-do\" attitude to roll up his sleeves and get things done. Dave is also an all-around great human. He has tremendous empathy and compassion for others, and often came to me to celebrate other team members' accomplishments and to praise others for their contributions to his projects. He looks out for people around him, and ensures everyone is set up for success. Dave enjoyed mentoring and coaching newer members on our team, and people naturally gravitated to him when they were in need of assistance. Dave made an indelible mark on SAP Concur, and any team would be fortunate to have him in their ranks.‚Äù"

And it did. Two decades, and a lot of learning later, I am my hero, totally at calm within, and outside. While following the lives of the great ones, and the famous ones, and the rich and fortunate ones, I discovered that the only person I can influence and better, is myself. Yes, a Jeff Bezos or an Elon Musk, or a Rafa Nadal story sounds great, and they inspire me on a daily basis. But that‚Äôs them. I am my own individual with my ideas, and my shortcomings. And it‚Äôs my choice to pick happiness over a position, travel over a foreign education, kindness over proving a point. I grew up the day I realised that I control my happiness, and that happiness comes from the inside. My only aim is to become the best version of myself, and since I have been at it for a long, long, time, the process is effortless!",

            "Dave C. ‚ÄúI consider myself incredibly lucky to have worked alongside Kate, where I was able to observe as she led and supported her team, and I could not recommend her enough. It's easy to become a manager. Almost anyone can do it. Do your job, show a passing interest in leadership, pull some numbers/metrics, and sit in your seat for a few years. But it is not easy to become a good manager. Kate is a good manager. What makes a good manager? This is a question I've asked myself a lot as someone that, in their entire time at McAfee, has had a total of 8 managers (pretty much one manager per year at this point). I've seen individuals where I can objectively look at them and go \"Oh, they are okay\" or \"Yikes, glad I don't report to them\", and in Kate's case, \"Dang, that's a good leader\". Whenever I try to define for myself how I come to this determination of \"what makes a good manager\", It aways boils down to the same 3 (totally related) concepts: Supportive, empathetic, mindful. Kate is all of these things and more. I consider it my absolute privilege to have seen Kate stand up for the value of her team time and time again; the quality of their output, the professionalism in their delivery, and the attention to detail they so often provided. A good manager instills that sort of confidence and delivery in the people they lead - and I will state again, for the 3rd time in this recommendation, Kate is that good manager.‚Äù",
            "Michael Labate ‚ÄúKate is a true people leader and a master of her craft. She managed me directly for almost three years, and in that time I felt continuously supported and encouraged. I was always given the independence I needed to succeed in a senior role, but could always trust in her guidance and mentorship whenever I needed it. She fostered a highly collaborative content design team where we all felt comfortable sharing our work and tackling problems together. I learned immensely from her feedback and her strategic, scalable approach to resolving issues of all sorts and sizes. Kate really cares about the people she manages. She sees the potential in others and does everything she can to nurture their growth and help them achieve their goals. I highly recommend her as a content design leader.‚Äù"

            "Tiffany Chan ‚ÄúJim was one of the best sales managers I‚Äôve had the privilege of working with throughout my career. I‚Äôm grateful to have had the opportunity to improve my sales skills with his leadership and support. Jim is data driven and his strategic thinking helped his direct reports move deals forward and across the finish line. Jim‚Äôs management not only produced a top performing team but also a team that was bonded by deep friendships. Jim always made an effort to be curious about his team‚Äôs lives and he was always available to talk through things we had in our mind. On top of being an amazing front line manager, Jim shared resources and ideas with the entire Growth organization to drive success. I would highly recommend Jim to any company and look forward to working with him again in the future. ‚Äù",
            "Ian Powell ‚ÄúJim was a fantastic manager, and I learnt so much from him. Jim lead our South Central Team which not only was one of the top performing teams in the country, but an incredible working environment to be in. Jim was outstanding at seeing the forest through the tree's, and made our jobs as individual contributors focused and efficient. He was excellent at strategically thinking through business challenges, and an outstanding communicator on top of it. Jim's processes and ideas were replicated across Twilio's sales org, and made a huge impact across the company. I would highly recommend Jim for any company moving forward and I hope to work with him again some day.‚Äù"

            "Andrea Carlson ‚ÄúMelissa is a natural leader who makes it look so effortless. I have had the pleasure of working alongside Melissa for over 10 years at SAP and am continually inspired by her dedication to the success of her programs, and most importantly to the success of her team. Planning events can be extremely stressful at times and she has an amazing way of keeping the team encouraged by affirming those around her and offering professional mentorship to those who may need it. She believes in giving back to her team which inspires us all to do the same. She is not intimidated by executive level titles, and is not afraid to make decisions and to stand by them. She is a constant advocate for her peers, and she truly wants those around her to shine. Melissa is an absolute gem and I know that she is an asset to any team.‚Äù",
            "Johann Wrede ‚ÄúMelissa has ability to both manage an incredible amount of complexity and keep her eye on the outcome. When the going gets tough, she displays courage, tenacity and creativity to clear every hurdle put in her path. My first time meeting Melissa, she was on-site overseeing the final stages of an event build while battling morning sickness. Seeing her work through that told me everything I needed to know about her mettle and determination. Empathetic, calm and full of integrity, Melissa is someone who I would choose to have on my team 100% of the time.‚Äù"

            "Duncan Greenwood ‚ÄúAngela is a truly inspirational in developing talent in an organisation. I have worked with Angela for 12 months and in that time she has presented a positive challenge and refreshing outlook on what I should be concentrating on to get the most out of my career. Angela refused to take a functional appoach, preferring to tailor activity and exercises that enabled me to control the outcomes relative to my goals. I have no hesitation reccomending Angela as a high value coach and partner for leadership learning & development.‚Äù",
            "Matt Hodey ‚ÄúThrough shared connections at Henley Management College I had the good pleasure recently to work with Angela. She exudes an excellent client manner, is prepared to ask the question that needs asking and is without question well suited to a coaching, learning and development background. I do hope we will work again together in the future and wish her well on her post-Henley journey. Thanks Angela, best wishes, Matt‚Äù"

            "Philip Miseldine ‚ÄúJason needs a different kind of recommendation. Typing into a text field cliched superlatives just can't serve justice to the natural, warm fit I feel when working with Jason. How to explain it? Let's try. You know that feeling of finishing that long workshop, still jet lagged, ready for a hotel meal and bed? Jason is the sole reason you can't wait to go out that evening, go to bed late and skip breakfast, because how could you not exchange more ideas, hang out, and learn from him? That's Jason. Or that late evening, timezone dependent call. Set at 7pm...sigh...You wake up, you review your calendar, see that late night meeting...that's the meeting you look forward to most just because it's with Jason. He'll inspire you, entertain you, and you know for sure something special will come out of it. His expertise and creativity in analytics, the technology sector, and its application to defence leaves you with a head full of ideas. Without doubt, if you need an explosively innovative mindset, bursting at the seams with ideas, passion, and creativity, Jason has you covered. If you also need a kind, considered, thoughtful innovator on top? Jason has both in spades. He's a uniquely talent person, and someone I always look towards for inspiration, and that rock n roll spirit in software innovation.‚Äù",
            "Tony Strickland ‚ÄúI had the privilege of working with Jason Shearer from 2015-2017 while we established the foundations for a Continuous Improvement program at the Salt Lake City site for L3 Technologies. With his expertise in architecting and constructing database systems and technology infrastructures, we literally put together a technology infrastructure for a population of 3,500 employees - fully functional - in less than 9 months after I joined the company. It was incredible to have multiple moments where I would ask for a new functionality, a design change, or a user-interface update and Jason's response would either be \"I have already completed that and am ready to show you\" or when I asked to have the modification within two weeks, I would almost always get it within two days. Jason is keenly insightful, strategic-thinking, detail-focused and a delightful person to have drive innovation and change. I fully support any decisions to have him lead, or be a part of, a strategic leadership team for technology and visionary improvements that any organization is looking to implement.‚Äù"

Luis was also passionate about driving opportunities to support SAP‚Äôs DEI initiatives and shared his experience and network within our CSM teams freely.

Colmenares during my master‚Äôs degree at Immaculata University, a time marked by the unique challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Professor Colmenares stood out not only for his ability to adapt the curriculum to real-world events, but also for his practical, case-based approach to teaching that made complex concepts highly engaging and applicable. His combination of deep expertise, practical insight, and human approach to leadership and education makes him an exceptional educator and mentor. I‚Äôm grateful to have learned from him and would highly recommend him to anyone seeking a thoughtful and forward-thinking leader in the field of technology and leadership.‚Äù"

Working with both mothers and children in these critical early years sets up the entire family for good health and establishes a strong foundation for learning. Yet, many Chester County families who are struggling merely to make ends meet and to provide the basic essentials are not able to focus on their child‚Äôs health and development.
