            "Matt Javit “It's hard to imagine that better leadership could exist for a $B+ unit than Raj Nath. With extraordinary intellect and social IQ, savviness with an unbelievable ability to adjust in the moment, and a genuinely humble approach with all parts of the organization, he is a CEO who walks the walks, always delivering to his commitments. His kind, thoughtful demeanor is calming in the most anxious of times and appreciated by all that work with him. Having Raj lead the final stages of a particular multiyear, multimillion-dollar deal, gave me the chance to work alongside him as we built out the global delivery model, leveraged the national sales organization, and negotiated with the client. His respect for all of the people he engaged with at the client, from fresh new grad to the C-suite, and his ability to stay present in every conversation was inspiring and motivating. I've never enjoyed working harder for someone than I did for Raj Nath, and I am grateful I had the opportunity. ”",
            "Terrance Bilbo “Raj has been fantastic partner. He assembled a team to handle a first generation multi-tower ITO deal and remained vigilant, engaged and committed to achieving the business case. Though he has a large portfolio of other clients, his attention to our account always made me feel as though we were his only engagement. I am grateful for all the support and leadership he has provided.”"

At Capgemini, I led the global social media and advocacy function—shaping content across 180+ channels, launching new storytelling formats like podcasts and video, and building an employee advocacy program used by 340,000 people. I also developed global governance frameworks, authored social media guidelines, and led a distributed team of content and digital professionals across regions. Alongside that, I managed paid media budgets of $1M+ and created executive visibility programs, helping our CEO become a LinkedIn Top Voice. What ties it all together is my belief in thoughtful, purposeful communication. Whether I’m devising strategy, writing copy, or leading a team, I care most about content that’s authentic, clear, and useful to the audience. I’m especially motivated by work that helps organizations show up with integrity—and that builds real trust with their audiences. Expert in: • Content & Editorial Strategy • Social Media & Employee Advocacy • Digital Campaigns & Paid Media • Executive Visibility & Thought Leadership • Governance, Enablement & Team Leadership Outside of work, you’ll usually find me listening to (or playing) music, cooking something my children don’t want to eat, or watching TV shows about terrible things happening to people. Let’s connect.",

Reporting directly to Joe, I experienced firsthand his exceptional mentorship and the positive impact he had on my professional growth. Joe is not only a brilliant social media strategist but also a genuinely good human being. His ability to connect with each team member on a personal level made a significant difference in my development. Joe's guidance and encouragement helped me navigate challenges and achieve my career goals. One of Joe's standout qualities is his mentorship. He entrusted me with projects and tasks, stepping back to let me take center stage. This approach was instrumental in boosting my confidence at work. I highly recommend Joe Morris for any role that requires a compassionate leader with a deep understanding of social media and employee advocacy. His mentorship and human touch would be an invaluable asset to any organization. I don't say this lightly...he's by no means an ordinary Joe...he's the best of the best....the crème de la crème.”",
            "Anirban G. “I had the privilege of working in Joe's team for nearly four years, and it was an enriching and transformative experience. Joe is an exceptional leader who masterfully balances attention to detail with strategic vision. His expertise in Paid Media, Social Media, Employee Advocacy, and integrated marketing consistently guided our team through complex challenges. What makes Joe truly remarkable is his commitment to empowering his team—encouraging ownership, fostering innovation, and turning bold ideas into impactful outcomes. His leadership drives excellence and delivers meaningful business results. Thank you, Joe, for your guidance, mentorship, and the incredible journey. Any organization would be fortunate to have you!”"

Ashley is very detail oriented and willing to dive into any area of law she is asked to research. As an example, Ashley was asked to reseach and work on a number of projects regarding HIPPA and Business Associate Agreements. Ashley did such a great job of research and learning about how the regulations apply to our business that she quickly became the subject matter expert within our department on the topic. I would highly recommend Ashley for a role within the legal field anytime!”"

This thesis presents a simulation model to evaluate temporal and spatial consolidation rules. The model is the result of a research project to analyze freight consolidation options for a large industrial company. The research project focused on the company's freight imported from China to the US, and the model presented in the thesis is structured to represent a typical import logistics network. The results section of the thesis presents a method for evaluating consolidation rules. The results recommend temporal consolidation of two weeks at the origin port and temporal consolidation of less than one week at the factory for the company's shipments from China to the US. This consolidation policy offers total network cost savings of 24% over the base case, an immediate ship policy."

            "Peter A. Schwartz “The most effective global marketing leaders have one eye fixed on the horizon and the other on their organization’s current position. They are problem-finders and problem-solvers. And for their clients, they continually seek new ways to create value and new value to create. In my experience working with Heather, I found her to be a highly creative, growth-oriented market strategist. She was able to put herself in the shoes—and even the minds—of her firm’s clients, prospects, and competitors. She also made a point of understanding the complex social systems at play in her work environment and provided her global teams with the context, purpose, and values to encourage their best efforts and support their professional development. Perhaps most important, people who work with and for Heather feel noticed, included, and appreciated.”",
            "Barbara Chai “Heather inspires the strongest loyalty from her team members in a remarkable way. She balances candor with compassion when communicating with her team, and is a fierce advocate for her people when communicating outside of her team. Even long after she has finished serving in a role, she continues to check in on her former team members to ask how they’re doing, provide a gut check or offer to help in any way. She is passionate about her work and her people, and takes great pride in mentoring and nurturing younger colleagues. As a peer, Heather is supportive, generous and collaborative. When she sees good work, even when done by other teams, she props it up and shines a spotlight on all the people who contributed to it. She is always learning in addition to teaching. She is a mentor to a wide range of people and generously offers her time and guidance when asked. It is this quality that truly distinguishes Heather as a leader. She is also a master at her craft. Her communication style is confident and sharp. Her strategies are data-informed, experience-driven and multi-layered. She is a creative, analytical and persuasive storyteller. Her ability to see and describe the picture from miles above in the sky, and from underneath a canopy of trees, is inspiring. Above all, Heather is a very kind and thoughtful person. She is a rare talent and any organization would be lucky to have her as a leader.”"

He takes the time to truly understand the depth of his clients’ issues as well as how to best tailor solutions to address their needs. This has been no small feat, as we crafted solutions to address complex supply chain issues in an even more complex Semiconductor industry. He’s also one of the most positive and optimistic people I’ve worked with, and I’ve learned a lot from him. ”",
            "John Waite “I had the enormous privilege to work with Sandeep at Genpact where he led the Semiconductor Sale Team. His amazing knowledge of the semiconductor industry coupled with his passion for driving major outcomes for clients, while mentoring team mates is truly impressive. Sandeep also has a patient, yet tenacious style and team members continually seek him out for advice and counsel. He operates with the highest integrity and always seeks a shared success in all he does. I hope our paths cross again so I can work with him once more and continue to learn from him.”"

The reality is that social media does not represent a revolution in marketing or customer engagement but it does represent a significant evolution, and one that presents businesses with greater opportunities. In order to really leverage social media, organizations need to stop looking at it as a separate world and look at how the normal processes of customer identification and acquisition can be extended to incorporate the social world.Treating social media as another enterprise information asset and incorporating it into the overall enterprise information map will deliver the benefits expected from social media marketing but even more so, will enable the collaboration of physical, electronic and social marketing, and provide risk and servicing areas with better information on the customer and how they behave."

This book argues that for SOA to succeed we must move our thoughts away from the implementation technologies and towards the \"what\" of the business. Using a straight-forward, pictorially driven, methodology the book explains who to discover what the business services really are and how to construct an overall business service architecture. The book covers defining the Business Service Architecture, how to classify services for business value and delivery, understanding the role of IT in supporting the architecture, how project and portfolio management needs to change, how to use a Service Architecture to identify KPIs, and how and when to use Business Process in a service architecture."

              "description": "The methodologies such as extreme programming and the Rational Unified Process claim that they work with service-oriented architecture, but neither was designed with SOA in mind. Both predominately focuses on a project's delivery, not on the system's initial conceptualization. For service definition to succeed, there must be tooled support for the automatic flow of information among architects, designers, developers, maintainers, and, most importantly, the client. XML and Web service standards are helping architects improve the definition of service and provide a consistent framework for realizing service-oriented architecture's promises."

              "description": "The airline industries are going through a period of change and face many challenges to keep consumers loyal to their services and to offer differential services with low production cost. The rise of J2ME mobile phones presents an opportunity and a challenge to airline companies, the chance to increase information available to passengers to reduce dissatisfaction, and the challenge of how to produce applications for a wide variety of devices. It also enables companies to offer additional services via an application that is resident on the consumer?s own phone. Using the security and storage options available on J2ME devices, airlines, and other companies, can use mobile phones as a mechanism to enable \"least resistance\" selling. This paper details how one prototyping exercise demonstrated how J2ME mobile phones, both on the original MIDP 1.0 and the more advanced MIDP 2.0 offered a clear business and cost advantage to one UK based airline. Hopefully by the time this paper is read the prototypes will be functioning systems that are being used by consumers."

He is not just an excellent technical manager but also someone who has a great eye in picking and nurturing the right talent in the team. He is someone who don’t shy away in showering praise with open heart, and also pin-pointing corrections with equal effect and without mincing the words; a true hallmark of a great leader. This has been quite long overdue; but deep down in my heart I knew I would only be able to write a note about you after I reach a certain level of maturity. There are still miles to go before I reach your level of calm and generosity; however I would like to take this opportunity to thank you in reinstalling in me the importance of being humble and polite while dealing with the people; be it professional or personal life. Cheers.”",
            "Srinivas Kulkarni “Raman managed a very challenging project for my division. He has shown tremendous resilience, and ability to work under pressure. His project management skills are commendable. He managed a culturally diverse and large team across multiple geographic locations. I am happy to endorse him for his professional competence.”"

An insanely approachable leader you could count on under any circumstance; he will go out of his way to help people meet their goals while ensuring organisational objectives remain in focus & met. His style of managing cross-functional teams is such, pretty much everyone in the team would remain actively involved & hardly feel managed. Ravi is a tremendous asset to any team & wish him the very best!”",

He understands the nuances of the situation at hand, works out various options and measures the outcome probability before finally executing on the option. I have seen him working on large enterprise deals, managing the complexity and collaborating across various functions to deliver the mandate. He is an asset to any team he works for.”"

Throughout the short and expedient hiring process, Allison was attentive to my requirements and worked diligently to finalize an offer. She has even followed up with me multiple times ensuring I am settling into my new role. If you're thinking about making a change, I'd recommend Allison be the first person you call.”"

The reality is that social media does not represent a revolution in marketing or customer engagement but it does represent a significant evolution, and one that presents businesses with greater opportunities. In order to really leverage social media, organizations need to stop looking at it as a separate world and look at how the normal processes of customer identification and acquisition can be extended to incorporate the social world.Treating social media as another enterprise information asset and incorporating it into the overall enterprise information map will deliver the benefits expected from social media marketing but even more so, will enable the collaboration of physical, electronic and social marketing, and provide risk and servicing areas with better information on the customer and how they behave."

This book argues that for SOA to succeed we must move our thoughts away from the implementation technologies and towards the \"what\" of the business. Using a straight-forward, pictorially driven, methodology the book explains who to discover what the business services really are and how to construct an overall business service architecture. The book covers defining the Business Service Architecture, how to classify services for business value and delivery, understanding the role of IT in supporting the architecture, how project and portfolio management needs to change, how to use a Service Architecture to identify KPIs, and how and when to use Business Process in a service architecture."

Both predominately focuses on a project's delivery, not on the system's initial conceptualization. For service definition to succeed, there must be tooled support for the automatic flow of information among architects, designers, developers, maintainers, and, most importantly, the client. XML and Web service standards are helping architects improve the definition of service and provide a consistent framework for realizing service-oriented architecture's promises."

The rise of J2ME mobile phones presents an opportunity and a challenge to airline companies, the chance to increase information available to passengers to reduce dissatisfaction, and the challenge of how to produce applications for a wide variety of devices. It also enables companies to offer additional services via an application that is resident on the consumer?s own phone. Using the security and storage options available on J2ME devices, airlines, and other companies, can use mobile phones as a mechanism to enable \"least resistance\" selling. This paper details how one prototyping exercise demonstrated how J2ME mobile phones, both on the original MIDP 1.0 and the more advanced MIDP 2.0 offered a clear business and cost advantage to one UK based airline. Hopefully by the time this paper is read the prototypes will be functioning systems that are being used by consumers."

We have worked closely across two different organizations, and I must mention that I have seldom seen such excellent collaboration, ownership and the desire to drive a team to success in the past! Sanjay always has a attitude to turn a negative situation into a highly positive outcome, and in the process he extends is recognition to all the contributors as a true leader. He has great Account Management and Customer Management acumen, understands the right triggers and creates a win-win situation for both his organization and the customer he manages. I wish Sanjay all the best, and hope that he reaches great heights in his professional endeavors; he is also a true friend provides constant support through good times and guidance when the going is not so great!”",

Sanjay keeps himself in a humble and learning mindset to transform himself in work and life. He is also a master of metaphor and bigger-picture inspiration. I also felt inspired to see the growth and transformation of Sanjay. Thank you for co-creating this unforgettable journey for me! :)”"

Over the years, we have conducted many EM sessions together and those were always the best experiences. What I like the most is his open way to mentor the participants effortlessly. To me, he is one of the best examples of people centric leader, who never shies away from helping others. From his vast pool of experiences in delivery, stakeholder management and financial management, he always picks up right examples to coach his team. He truly embodies Team Spirit and Fun, the two Capgemini values. I always look forward to working with him, since while working with him is the best enjoyment.”",
            "Ambili Ramkumar “Dinesh is a fine combination of democratic and a situational leadership. I have worked with him for a short duration on a super critical Product implementation program where he had to fly down almost every week for the first few months. He showed us how to stabilise critical situations, break down the issues to small chunks, invite in right support systems and showed us the way forward. He is full of fun, stories and tricks, and not to mention, those that I have adopted over time...If I know something in agile now, I owe it to him. He is a \"walking\" agilist who breathes Agile and demonstrates what agile should be.. If you have an issue, call him, he will have an idea for you !”"

            "Vincent Wall “Beyond Brett's fun, sometimes irreverent, boyish charm is a strong intellect, tangible commitment to the clients success, tenacity and courage. He was always willing to have the tough conversation with clients and even when it went badly, he picked himself up and came back for more!! He is willing to have the ferocious conversation that a world class business advisor should have with his client. A testament to his strength of character is his commitment that the client hear what they might not like to hear. I respect Brett, as he is willing to risk not being liked, so that his clients prosper and thrive. I worked with Brett on many business reinvention projects and though we didn't always see eye-to-eye, The client thrived, their business prospered, the teams soared and I personally grew from his contribution. When you or your team want results and don't mind being prodded to perform, I recommend you partner with Brett in Business.”"

            "Binh Nguyen “I had the privilege of working with Dinaz at IBM where she led TA delivery for one of the most critical segments. Dinaz is a highly respected TA operator and was my strongest functional leader in North America. She’s an experienced and mature TA leader, passionate advocate for her teams, and exhibits true back-bone when others shy away from pressure. Dinaz is also the hardest-working leader I’ve met in my 20 years, always there from her team and peers. I leaned on Dinaz heavily for her wisdom and voice of reason, and often sought her advice on critical decisions. While she was direct report, she has many of the attributes I admire in a great manager. Just an overall impressive individual. I’m fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Dinaz and have learned much from her in the last few years.”"

Under her leadership Capgemini India architects’ community and especially diversity initiatives have grown by leaps and bounds in the past few years. She has a good eye for talent that has helped us build a strong core team for Women in Delivery initiative in Capgemini. She has always led by example – be it winning several awards for her contribution or putting in sincere effort to clear technical certifications. She encourages others and helps her team grow in their own chosen career paths. Hope she continues to be the guiding star and a role model for many others.”"

There are number of popular test management tools in the market today, however, achieving optimal test coverage with minimal tests has become more challenging and the need for using the right tools and methods has become more significant than ever. Architecting tests in order to achieve the right test coverage involves robust test design, execution, management methods, and best practices. In this presentation, Shiva will discuss methodologies and best practices coupled with an objective metrics and risk based test model that can achieve test coverage without compromising cost or quality."

              "description": "One of the key principles behind XP testing and software development is effective communication and transparency between clients QA testers, software programmers, SME’s and the end users. If there is anything that has been emphasised repeatedly about agile methods, it is the need for real-time communication, preferably face-to-face. This physical proximity is one of the several reasons why agile techniques are so effective. But considering the factors of cost saving and faster time to market, the same approach cannot be taken for a large project or on a long term basis to gain business value. One of the viable solutions to address the above situation is the implementation of a “Distributed eXtreme Programming Testing”. This white paper explores the need of Distributed XP testing, provides a primer on key challenges of implementation and illustrates the approach of addressing the challenge. The white paper also discusses our experiences in performing Distributed XP testing and has also shown that at the end of day, we can stay true to the values and principles of XP and not compromising the practices in a distributed environment. A Distributed testing teams actively collaborate on a common software/ systems project separated by Distance, Time zone, Culture. In Distributed XP testing model, the team members are physically apart bringing in a relaxation to the XP principle. The team can be distributed across various geographical locations and offshore centres. The offshore team in conjunction with “virtual” team (again at offshore) bridge the distance and bring in XP practices to Distributed testing"

Over the years, we have conducted many EM sessions together and those were always the best experiences. What I like the most is his open way to mentor the participants effortlessly. To me, he is one of the best examples of people centric leader, who never shies away from helping others. From his vast pool of experiences in delivery, stakeholder management and financial management, he always picks up right examples to coach his team. He truly embodies Team Spirit and Fun, the two Capgemini values. I always look forward to working with him, since while working with him is the best enjoyment.”",
            "Ambili Ramkumar “Dinesh is a fine combination of democratic and a situational leadership. I have worked with him for a short duration on a super critical Product implementation program where he had to fly down almost every week for the first few months. He showed us how to stabilise critical situations, break down the issues to small chunks, invite in right support systems and showed us the way forward. He is full of fun, stories and tricks, and not to mention, those that I have adopted over time...If I know something in agile now, I owe it to him. He is a \"walking\" agilist who breathes Agile and demonstrates what agile should be.. If you have an issue, call him, he will have an idea for you !”"

            "Mark Brady “It is an absolute privilege to recommend Satish, one of the most innovative and results-driven professionals I’ve enjoyed working with. During his time with our organization, Satish redefined what success looks like in Talent Acquisition, achieving remarkable outcomes and leaving an indelible mark on our operations. I witnessed Satish’s unparalleled ability to identify opportunities for improvement and deliver impactful results firsthand. Satish spearheaded process optimization efforts that streamlined operations and saved the company approximately $500K. Satish elevated team efficiency and accuracy to the next level. Satish also transformed and relaunched the Talent Acquisition function, implementing clear recruiter metrics, refined candidate outreach templates, process documentation, and streamlined stakeholder communication workflows—all of which contributed to heightened operational performance. Satish empowered our teams to make data-driven decisions with greater confidence. Additionally, Satish enhanced our employee referral program, which is a testament to his ability to engage employees and attract top-tier talent. Satish’s commitment to fostering a more inclusive workplace was equally admirable. I saw him lead impactful Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs that enriched our talent mix and reinforced our commitment to building a diverse workforce. Satish’s contributions extended far beyond operational improvements. He introduced a robust recruitment knowledgebase and optimized ATS functionality, completely reinventing workflows to improve candidate and stakeholder experience. His strategic vendor management efforts, which included renegotiations and onboarding proven partners, delivered cost savings while enhancing capabilities. What truly sets Satish apart is his leadership and forward-thinking mindset. His ability to foster collaboration, inspire teams, and align strategies with broader organizational goals drives exceptional results. Satish brings a balance of innovation, expertise, and passion to every project he undertakes. To anyone considering hiring Satish, I can confidently say you won’t find a more dedicated, visionary, and effective leader in Talent Acquisition. Satish is a true asset and an inspiration to everyone fortunate enough to work alongside them.”",
            "Meave Groves-Backer “I was fortunate to work with Satish during his time with Capgemini. I have worked with some truly amazing managers over the course of my career and Satish is one of the best. He is very team oriented, down to earth, and a calming influence in any stressful situations. Satish takes a very direct approach to issues that his team faces and is 100% supportive of them in everything that are doing. I learned a great deal from Satish during my time reporting to him and if our paths cross in the future, I would welcome the chance to work with him again.”"

He is the exceptional blend of data science expertise plus team management and executive presence. Working with him turned machine learning from experimentation into methodology and delivery, while forming strong team culture and cohesion at the same time. He could explain machine learning to senior business leaders as well as get in the details with the team as required. On top of all of that, James is a very even-keeled personality and brings that steadiness and persistence to the team and stakeholders. I have enjoyed and learned quite a lot from working with James.”",
            "Matthew Williams “I reported directly to James throughout 2013-2014, working closely with him on several highly visible marketing analytics implementation projects. James has acute technical expertise in integrating complex multichannel analytics solutions for enterprise businesses. An endless fountain of knowledge, James also acted as a great mentor for helping me learn all things 'marketing attribution' related. James was an extremely valuable resource to have on our Solutions Engineering team, and I would be more than happy to work with him again on future projects.”"

            "Jackie Johanson “First things first, Johnny is a wonderful team member. He's so invested in his work yet makes the effort to keep up personal connections and bring light-hearted banter to everyday interactions–which I really appreciate. Johnny is a thoughtful collaborator and excels at combining the strengths of others, together with his own to deliver impactful content campaigns. When Johnny is tackling an unfamiliar subject matter (which is common in the world of technology innovation) he is quick to research and learn the topic, helping him to steer content creators, subject matter experts, and creative teams to produce accurate & compelling content that hit on the marketing strategy. Johnny is a master multi-tasker and genius prioritizer. You won't catch him off guard or unorganized. He's a reliable communicator and keeps everyone around him on top of their game.”",
            "Gail Gordon “I had the pleasure of working with Johnny while in Enterprise IT at Boeing. We focused on our internal customers and communication for the organization. Johnny is a motivated self-starter and accomplishes all his projects on time and with quality. He is tenacious, a diplomatic team player and a dedicated team member. His work ethic and concern for the customer experience are beyond measure. He always takes the customer into consideration in everything he does. When working customer requests Johnny always replied within a timely manner. He would either have an answer, research the topic or contact one of our subject matter experts. Johnny quickly became a person to go to for technical answers and knowing who to point the customer to. He also put together self-help videos and a monthly newsletter with articles focused on areas of customer interest. In doing so, he collaborated with the team to provide simplified directions on a broad range of topics (mobile devices and computers) on our website for those customers who needed clarity on the technical speak. In working with Johnny, I have learned from his insights and we were able to share ideas and strategies. Johnny will be a valuable asset to any organization and has a passion for working with a technical consumer-facing product or service. ”"

            "MAGGIE NATION “There are executive recruiters and there are talent whisperers. Christine Stack belongs in that latter rarefied group. I've probably worked with 30+ recruiters over my career. Some were 3rd-party hired hands, others worked internally. Some had amazing follow-up skills, others ghosted me. From the minute that Christine reached out to me on LI, I knew she was would be different. And she was. Engaging, informed, candid and wonderfully authentic – Christine made it clear that she would be as much my champion as she was the brand she represented, Capgemini Invent. She was frank – even brutally honest – about the opportunity and what it would take to thrive in that role. Christine has become the yardstick by which I'll measure every other recruiter by. If she reaches out to you, be sure to respond – you won't regret it.”",
            "Aditi Kejriwal “Christine is one of the best Exec Recruiters I've come across so far. She recently helped me with hiring one of the VPs in our HR & Workforce Experience Consulting practice and it was an excellent experience. I was thoroughly impressed with Christine's listening skills and compassion for the Candidate as well as me. She was very professional, laid out the process very clearly and made sure the right rigor and discipline was injected through the process. She maintained honest and regular communication with the candidate too, and got excellent feedback from the candidate. Christine is a real asset for Capgemini and I look forward to our continued cooperation, as we build the Workforce & Organization practice together.”"

            "Beth Rimmer “I’ve had the pleasure of working with Andrew Pham during his career progression from a Business Analyst to a Solution Architect at Ascentium. As an individual contributor, Andrew has demonstrated a dynamic and versatile repertoire of skills. His unique advantage is that he is keenly aware of both the customer and end-user’s expectations and adept at translating those expectations into the end-solution. As a team-member, he quickly buids rapport and trust with his team and customers, and has an unmatched work ethic for doing the job right. On countless occasions I’ve referenced a deliverable he’s created and said “use Andrew’s example: the client and team loved it.””",
            "Aaron McCoy “I have worked with Andrew over the past year at Ascentium Los Angeles, and I must say that I am very sorry to see him go. He has been the most influential individual on a number of projects, and his dedication to each aspect of his work has been nothing short of amazing. Each and every task that Andrew is responsible for is delivered at the very highest level (and on time). Andrew's personality and attitude around the office make it a pleasure to work with him each and every day. He listens to the input of others, and makes them feel appreciated and important. He leads others extremely well, and works within a team the way you wish each member would. I would highly recommend Andrew for any position, not just as a business analyst. Andrew is constantly working on learning new things outside of his required discipline, and I believe that he can adapt to anything.”"

While attending his webinar, I was captivated by the real-life examples that he shared while delivering the topic. It was great to have him at the Headstart Network Foundation’s Patna chapter event as the key speaker on the topic - “What companies expect while hiring.” To align with the vision of Headstart in promoting entrepreneurship, Sajjad also covered how the startup experience can be an add-on in the resume that can attract the companies. The students and budding entrepreneurs gave very good feedback about the presentation and Q&A session. It was our pleasure to have him on our webinar. I hope that as a City lead of Headstart Patna Chapter this collaboration continues. ”",

Thanks for all your support and look forward to work with you soon again.”",
            "Ranga Mohan “I reported to Aftab during the 3 years I worked on the ACH project at Bank of America for Infosys. He showed excellent project/program management and leadership skills. He was instrumental in building the development team both onsite and offshore. Aftab championed the delivery model in the ACH project charting out monthly milestones, managing all dependencies, risks along the way. As my direct manager he was very supportive of my career growth in Infosys by providing very valuable feedback. He is definitely one of the best managers I have worked for at Infosys and would love to work with him in the future.”"

Claire joined the business with the remit of expanding our Power Platform business, growing our capability and helping standardise our approach to projects. This is something which Claire excelled at. Her willingness to learn and take on new responsibilities is exemplary. This skillset saw her take on the Delivery Manager role for the wider data team which again had a very positive outcome. Claire's contribution cannot be over stated, she played a very large role in our success and expansion. Claire is a team player and enjoys contributing and watching others grow, providing opportunities to junior members and supporting them through their development. Claire's efforts continue to have a positive impact on the business and I look forward to watching her continue to achieve greatness.”",
            "Kevin Paige “I worked with Claire at Manx Telecom where I was the CTO and Claire was hired to support our IT Transformation project. Claire role(s) was initially as our expert IT Solutions Architect working effectively across our existing IT team and a number of systems suppliers and contractors. Claire did a fantastic job for us by working through some very complex systems integrations challenges to find options and recommendations to keep the programme moving forward. Claire has excellent technical knowledge and business understanding, but perhaps more importantly, the ability take on all roles across the design and delivery chain by managing people, process and technology/suppliers to produce real business benefit outcomes is Claire best strength.”"

He knows how to get work done in a very good and supportive manner. Whatever duration I worked under him I learned a lot from him. He is also one of the best recruiters who knows how to work on niche skills. The belief and support he shown on me makes him different from other leaders which always motivates you to do better. We both have closed quite a few tuff roles. I always enjoyed working with with him.”",

He has a thorough knowledge of not only recruiting best practices, but also takes the time to learn about the businesses that he is supporting so that he can more effectively identify the talent that they need. I highly recommend him, and would work with Andy again in a minute.”"

            "David Rubin “I had the privilege to work with Andy during a large Salesforce implementation project. Andy was tasked with integrating 8 business units, all with varying SFDC experience, into a single enterprise instance. He simultaneously created standardized sales processes, key reporting analytics and an application governance model. My particular business unit had the most sophisticated implementation of SFDC, hence we were the BU most impacted during the integration. As such, Andy was sensitive to our needs and collaborated to ensure our requirements and best practice recommendations influenced the final design of the new org. I learned a lot from Andy, and many of his lessons prompted me to pursue my career in technology consulting. I would recommend Andy for any position where leadership, organization, and business process best practice guidance are paramount. Thank you Andy.”",
            "Bernie Daina “As a member of the founding management team responsible for personnel recruitment, selection and a variety of human-resources processes, I worked closely with Andy Forbes for almost two years at the web 2.0 startup for collectors, WorthPoint. Andy initiated and managed our IT and Development, including full-time domestic employees and outsourced, offshore IT and Engineering capabilities. His work was timely, effective, and reliable. He is a consummate team player, one who brings extraordinary energy, commitment, and know-how to an emerging-growth technology company. He is constructive, flexible, and tireless. Without Andy, our company would have suffered countless, potentially crippling glitches and delays. He knows startups inside out, and can consult on, or manage, the complexity involved in launching a new enterprise with a cheerful outlook and a can-do attitude. Great person!”"

He is very kind and easy to deal with, which made our relationship smooth as he allowed me to make suggestions and decisions on my own. What a great professional to have as a client. I’d gladly work with Andrew again.”",
            "Tyler Blair “Andrew Kemp was the Franchise Development Director responsible for both FIFA Ultimate Team 09 and 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. Having worked with Andrew for 2 years I discovered that he is clearly a person with a wealth of experience who can be relied upon to keep a project running smoothly. At times the relationship between Producers and DD's can be strenuous but Andrew knows how to keep it going in a direction that has the products best interests in mind, while protecting his reports from crushing work hours. He has a good sense of wit and humour which he often will use to lighten the mood of the team when things are a bit stressful. I would never hesitate to work with Andrew again in the future and hope to do so down the line.”"

Started programming at 12, spent many late nights at friend’s house over my teenage years learning operating systems, web pages, and the networking basics. We even started our own corporation at 18 (I was CEO! Unfortunately I had no idea how to run a business, but we gave it a good go!) I moved over to the outsourcing world at 20, and have had an amazing adventure supporting all things infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies ever since (with a focus on Wintel, VMware, and Automation) While my job has never said “developer”, I’ve coded and automated in various languages and toolsets the whole way, and absolutely love the creative problem solving it allows. Learning how to “shift left”, do continuous pipelines, perform configuration management, compliance testing, and reporting, containerize, orchestrate, and all the other tasks that make our work lives that much better and our customers effective has been amazing. Each day is a new challenge, and an opportunity to learn – and I’m excited for the possibilities we’re going to explore together.",

Aaron was instrumental in helping frame our strategic direction for our Microsoft suite of tools. He helped us understand what to focus on, how to drive change throughout the organization, and to best leverage the tools to deliver better outcomes. He played a key role in helping us convince our executive team, who was resistant to “cloud products”. By the time our projects kicked off, the pandemic had just started, and Aaron was a steady hand to guide us not only through how to effectively deploy these new tools, but how to best manage remote workers (which was new to us, but he was well versed in). Aaron is a trusted advisor to the organization and we were sad to see him move on from Enterprise Collaboration. Can’t say enough good things about Aaron! ”"

            "Jeff Bradley “Luisa interned with our team for six months, taking on new tool development, bug fixes and worked with other teams on the cleanup of technical debt. Her honesty and openness, coupled with technical skills, immediately made her a successful member of our team. If she didn't know something, she said so and was eager to learn from others. She was also good at saying when she wanted to dig in, because she felt there was progress she could make on her own. On her second day of the internship, she already had a pull request fixing a bug in our Python tools. She continued to implement fixes and adding new tools. Once she was familiar with our tools, Luisa identified and drove new improvements in our development environment. One of her major projects addressed the technical debt of compiler warnings that have crept into our C++ codebase. Luisa jumped in and quickly made an impact, working with technical leads from across the R&D department on code reviews and discussing approaches for the complex code needs. Luisa's a quick and eager learner, who made working with her easy and fun.”",

She's hard-working and resourceful. She can dive into projects, learn quickly and independently, and be productive in a short period of time. She would be a valuable asset to any organization.”"

            "Jeff Bradley “Luisa interned with our team for six months, taking on new tool development, bug fixes and worked with other teams on the cleanup of technical debt. Her honesty and openness, coupled with technical skills, immediately made her a successful member of our team. If she didn't know something, she said so and was eager to learn from others. She was also good at saying when she wanted to dig in, because she felt there was progress she could make on her own. On her second day of the internship, she already had a pull request fixing a bug in our Python tools. She continued to implement fixes and adding new tools. Once she was familiar with our tools, Luisa identified and drove new improvements in our development environment. One of her major projects addressed the technical debt of compiler warnings that have crept into our C++ codebase. Luisa jumped in and quickly made an impact, working with technical leads from across the R&D department on code reviews and discussing approaches for the complex code needs. Luisa's a quick and eager learner, who made working with her easy and fun.”",

She's hard-working and resourceful. She can dive into projects, learn quickly and independently, and be productive in a short period of time. She would be a valuable asset to any organization.”"

            "Jonathan Fearon “I’ve worked on a number of major projects requiring substantial business cases for multi-million pound investments - Jon is without doubt the most experienced business case developer I’ve come across. He consistently demonstrates a rigorous analytical approach combined with an advocatus diaboli style to provide an independent challenge and to ensure all sides are taken into account. He had a broad and deep range of skills in the project analysis space including a thorough understanding of benefits management. Jon is also an expert in project portfolio management and has helped shaped the assessment, direction and management of multi-billion pound project portfolios. A real hard worker who introduces fresh thinking into any assignment, he is a great team player to have on any project.”"

            "Jackie Johanson “Working with Jeff Hebert over the years has been one of the great privileges of my career. He’s not just an exceptional leader—he’s the kind of person who brings clarity, focus, and energy to everything he touches. Jeff has a remarkable ability to cut through the noise, simplify complex goals, and get people aligned and moving in the right direction. Whether we were navigating acquisitions, shifting market dynamics, or just the everyday challenges of growth, Jeff always led with a calm confidence, strategic precision, and an unwavering commitment to both performance and people. What I admire most is how he balances ambition with authenticity. Jeff leads with transparency and integrity. He knows how to rally teams around a vision, ask the right questions, and make tough calls without losing site of the human impact. He builds strong cultures and earns trust quickly (and keeps it) because he lives the values–not just talks about them. Jeff is the kind of superhuman leader who makes you better just by working with him. I learned a lot from him—and had a lot of fun along the way. Any team would be lucky to have him.”",
            "Redwood Stephens “Jeff leads a team of over 100 multidisciplinary hardware product development experts at Synapse. He leads by example, personally spearheading development of sophisticated people and process tools we rely on to manage the business. I feel incredibly fortunate to have Jeff on the team because he is conscientious, has strong critical thinking skills, and is motivated to improve all aspects of the business. ”"

            "Grace Park “I have gotten to know Nafiri over the last year while working on an engagement together. She is a strong leader with outstanding presence, strong communication skills, and the ability to analyze and make impactful decisions. She is well respected across various teams, and I have admired and learned from her leadership skills. This was why I jumped at the opportunity to be coached by her. For 3 months, Nafiri coached me for personal and professional development. She maintained the perfect balance of knowing when to facilitate and nudge me to a right direction or letting me lead to find the right direction myself. She ties in assessments, theories, and definitions she has learned throughout her trainings to applicable examples and coaching areas. She has shown her commitment by texting me reminders of action items I set for myself, asking how she can be helpful offline, and sending me resources relevant to our discussion. Throughout this duration, it reminded me that Nafiri is coaching me to form a solid approach of identifying conflict, forming a method of resolution, and planning the action. She is teaching skills and not solutions to prepare me for a self-sustaining methodology to resolve conflicts in the future. I feel better equipped to be confident in my personal and professional journey, and I attribute it greatly to her.”",
            "Anuradha Sinha “Passionate, enthusiast, talented, charming and ever approachable, those are only few words to describe her, but she is so much more than that. I was really lucky to get the chance to work along with Nafiri and it was a great learning experience for me. She is always very helpful and have really strong knowledge about her domain and work. I have always find her approach very professional and systematic but she also brings out-of-box thinking to regular orthodox work. I wish her all the success for future and wish I would get chance to work with her again.”"
