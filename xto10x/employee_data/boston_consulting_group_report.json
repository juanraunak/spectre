I am a current student at Indiana University who considers himself disciplined, empathetic, and self-driven. I have done many different things, but I enjoy the ones related to sports, business, and social impact. Sports helped me become a more disciplined person. Being empathetic has driven me to do social impact activities and be part of different organizations. Finally, when it comes to business, and I want to create something, I am a self-driven person who knows the goal and will get there. I want to use my education at Kelley School of business as a platform to grow, learn and experience new things. I am sure that the path I am taking and my values will set me off for a successful career in the business world.",

We were class members in Multinational Management at Wharton and collaborated as team members on various class projects.... this was when we weren't going off to the squash courts en masse to show off our collective lack of skill, but that is another issue altogether. In class Allison had the unique capability of being both an excellent thought leader as well as being a collaborative team member. She was humble about her contributions though as a rule they were incisive and insightful. When it came to crunch time, she worked harder than anyone. On top of all this, she had a great sense of humor, joie d'vivre and charm as well as a million watt smile (and sparkling eyes) that I still remember after all these years. Lucky those that can work with her.”"

            "Griffin Myers “It is a privilege to recommend my friend, colleague, and mentor, Mr. Jon Kaplan. I worked with Jon for nearly 3 years at the Boston Consulting Group in Chicago; I know him well both as a friend and as a professional. He is the consummate professional and leads with three striking qualities: (1) extraordinary depth and breadth of experience, (2) unparalleled skills a listener, and (3) impressive clarity of thought. First, Jon has been providing strategic advisory to leading firms around the globe for nearly his entire professional career. He has worked for numerous consultancies with hundreds of clients, and the results are the same: happy clients and impressive economic results. His experience stretches across all aspects of healthcare, and he has practical insights that drive results for clients. Very simply: I am often skeptical of the value of management consulting services. I am never skeptical of the value of Jon’s insight and value as an adviser. Second, Jon is the best listener I know. Imagine you are working with Jon: his skill is not simply finishing your sentences or sitting quietly while you talk. He actively listens and facilitates you communicating with him. Jon makes it easy for you to explain complex, often subtle problems. His clients and teams notice this skill; it makes everyone around him better. I work every day to develop this listening skill Jon has demonstrated. Third, Jon thinks and communicates with clarity. He listens well, and then he is able to summarize and simplify with precision and structure. Meetings with Jon never end without absolute clarity on the problem, the solution, and the approach. It is this experience, listening skill, and ability to communicate with clarity that makes Jon the consultant’s consultant. He is the ultimate professional as well as a friend, mentor, and adviser, and I would recommend him without reservation. For questions, feel free to reach out to me directly at griffinrmyers@gmail.com.”",
            "Dawj Sangster, Ph.D “Jon is such a wonderful individual to work with. No matter what level you were at in the company, Jon was always so pleasant with a great personality and wonderful smile. He brings intelligence, leadership and a wonderful personality to any position he holds, and we certainly wish him the very best in all he sets out to do!!!!”"

I have a very strong desire to help people and leave every environment that I am in better than the way I found it. That drive has now led me to the field of medical devices and using mechanical engineering skills to innovate and improve the lives of patients. Through research opportunities at school, I have been exposed to academic writing and publication, applications of MATLAB, FEA simulations, statistical analysis of data, and direct patient care. Through my internship at Baxter, I was able to see the industrial side of product development and run exploratory and Class C testing, investigate root causes of imperfections, create detailed business cases for VIP’s, and work in a deadline-oriented environment. With the broad range of skills through my education in mechanical engineering, I have pivoted towards Business Management Consulting with Boston Consulting Group. The complex problem solving, teamwork focus, and open-communication and growth has made my time there invaluable, and I am excited for it to continue! When I am not working or studying, I am incredibly active. I am continuing to run the 800 post-collegiately but I also love to trail-run, hike, rock-climb, paddleboard, and ski.",

An election to renew said referendum occurred this past May. In January, a former teacher of mine invited me to join a group of students he was putting together with the intention of spreading public awareness about the referendum. The goal of the operation was to win the vote so that Duneland could maintain its funding and continue to offer various programs. Most of the other surrounding districts had already voted for their own educational referenda, making it a matter of pride as well. The cause was spearheaded by PAC, a team of Duneland employees as well as some other prominent community members. Our student team, SLAC, was created to be a diverse team, composed of students of various extracurriculars (I represented the academic teams and choirs), with the purpose of supporting PAC and reaching our peers. I served as the SLAC representative to PAC; I attended the meetings of both and informed each about the other’s agenda. First, we in SLAC provided stations at which eligible students could register to vote at school. We know of about 350 students that registered at our stations. We then visited students during study halls with a presentation that outlined the positives of the tax increase and what they and their parents gained from its existence. We also helped PAC in canvassing neighborhoods and advertising at various community functions, garnering further support. We ultimately succeeded, winning the vote with nearly 75%. By participating in the campaign, I saw that citizens really can make a difference in their community. It is often difficult to see individual efforts bear fruit in the national or state public affairs, but we were able to see our efforts have a real impact on our community. Show less",

            "Amy Dickinson “I had the absolute pleasure of working under the leadership of Sayra at Dell Technologies, and I cannot emphasize enough what an incredible experience it was. Sayra exemplifies all the qualities of an exceptional leader. She possesses a remarkable ability to inspire and motivate her team members, fostering a positive and collaborative work environment. Her leadership style is characterized by trust, open communication, and genuine care for the professional and personal development of her employees. While in the Director of Marketing position at Dell, Sayra demonstrated an exceptional ability to orchestrate complex initiatives with remarkable success. She spearheaded a team of eleven talented individuals and her leadership style encouraged autonomy, creativity, and innovation, resulting in the delivery of exceptional outcomes. Under Sayra’s guidance, we developed an engaging, informative, and memorable event strategy that not only captivated our target audience but also delivered on crucial marketing-qualified leads and sales-qualified leads. With a budget exceeding $15 million, she expertly allocated resources to maximize our impact, ensuring every dollar was utilized effectively and efficiently. One of Sayra's greatest strengths lies in her ability to collaborate across diverse teams and build consensus to execute against the event plans. She fostered strong working relationships with stakeholders from various departments, including marketing, sales, operations, and finance. By leveraging her exceptional communication and negotiation skills, Sayra ensured that all parties were aligned, fully supported the event objectives, and worked together seamlessly. Furthermore, Sayra is incredibly approachable and easy-going, creating a positive and inclusive work environment. She actively encourages open dialogue, listens attentively to diverse perspectives, and makes informed decisions that consider the best interests of both the team and the organization. Her ability to make everyone feel heard and valued created a harmonious and collaborative atmosphere, where ideas could flow freely, and teamwork thrived. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to have worked under Sayra's leadership. Her guidance, trust, and easy-going nature made my time at Dell an incredibly rewarding experience, and I would not be where I am in my career today without Sayra's mentorship. I have no doubt that she will continue to excel in any leadership position she undertakes, and I wholeheartedly recommend her to any organization seeking an exceptional leader who fosters a supportive and high-performing team culture.”",
            "Becky Levanger “Sayra was my director (my manager's manager) when I first graduated from business school. I was in the Demand Gen marketing team which she managed along with the events team for the Enterprise Technology Division (pre-Dell acquisition). Since working at Dell EMC I spent 4 years working in events and have a deep appreciation for how exceptional Sayra is. She knows the industry backwards and forwards. She knows how to position the future possibilities of technological growth and innovation. She knows how to get people excited and feel like they are a part of something. I used so many of the things I saw modeled and learned from Sayra at Google in our Next and Partner Summit events. Beyond her skill set, Sayra is also just an absolutely phenomenal person. I adored working for her and was very sad to leave her team, in spite of the fact that I was coming to my dream job at Google. She and I were work out buddies, encouraged each other to be healthy, and actually started a 6am morning workout class that all of our other team members eventually started joining! She is the kind of person you hope to have as a friend, and the kind of boss you know you are so lucky to have. I have no hesitation in recommending her, and would be happy to be contacted in regards to any role that she is being considered for.”"

            "Jeff Cushing “I had the privilege of working with Chris for nearly 8 years at McKesson. As a member of my team, Chris demonstrated the attributes necessary to drive transformation in a large and complex organization. Chris lead the charge that introduced private cloud/consumption based computing and built a level of business partnership not experienced previously between IT and its internal customer base. He championed the use of agile methods of development in an organization unfamiliar with the practice and laid the framework for a centrally delivered contact center strategy that, for over a decade, was considered unattainable. Chris’ bold and confident approach to problem solving is an asset to himself and any organization with which he is associated. It would be a pleasure to work with Chris again in the future. ”",
            "Eric Chester “I wholeheartedly recommend Chris for any IT strategy or leadership role. We worked together on several large projects from contact center consolidation to building the architecture, financial model, and operational model for a leading edge hybrid cloud. Chris has a great talent for taking a vision, breaking it down into an executable plan, and executing on that plan. His financial acumen helped get many ideas off the ground. He fosters an environment of credibility and competence that would be an asset to any IT organization. I hope that Chris and I get to work together again in the future.”"

            "Amber Sironzkar “I have worked with Payal for about two years while she was spearheading the marketing program for the Media & Entertainment Practice at Ernst & Young, India. Payal is a remarkably intelligent and an organized professional. She not only excels at her job but also has a sound understanding and know-how of different nuances of elements that help businesses. Payal, according to me is a rare mix of productivity and ambition. An ardent enterprising person, she can take on new projects and complete them with an ease that is even though difficult but is critical to the practice's growth. Beyond the scope of her role, I have noticed her constant learning attitude, which helps her stay ahead of the curve in the end. She is a team player and a friendly person who will go beyond the conventional mix to make things happen. I suppose that is the reason what led to everyone across team liking her and supporting her efforts, beyond hierarchies. I believe she will undoubtedly make a mark for herself in her career trajectory. I wish her my best, for now, and future.”"

Corrie is not only a sensitive leader, but she also empowers her team to test and learn which enables them to push boundaries continuously. Even after having quite a lot on her plate as the Digital Marketing Director, she was able to devote time to each team member to collect and provide feedback periodically. All said and done, Corrie is a perfect people manager/leader and is always ready to back her team and help them grow further. I was truly lucky to have such an inspiring director, and I'm sure BCG feels the same way.”"

I was privileged to work for Tom for over 2 years and those were some of the best years of my career to date. For me Tom is a \"work hard play hard\" person, who pushes you to grow, think outside the box and develop as a professional and a human being. He shows you the path and is there to support you when you need him. If you get an opportunity to work for Tom (or in Tom's organization) grab the opportunity without thinking twice. Working side-by-side with Tom or better for him is like an MBA and a Masters in IT! ”"

The slow adoption reflects the difficulties of introducing agile into the multidimensional matrices—region, channel, and category—of consumer companies. These difficulties, however, should not dissuade CPG companies from doing so."

I designed my own study, got IRB (Internal Revenue Board) approval, conducted my surveys and wrote a research paper summarizing my results. The entire research process was an invaluable learning experience. I learned firsthand that research does not always proceed as planned. I am proud of my persistence and the result of my endeavor."

In addition, Mark is a stupendous business leader where his business skills combined with his management experience and knowledge have enabled him to successfully collaborate across business functions and ensure a successful secure and compliance based security program.”",
            "Michelle Finneran Dennedy “Mark is one of those folks who can actually help an organization get & keep \"information\" out of it's Information Technology investments. In his role as CISO for Sun, he could have spent a great deal of time & money building big walls to \"secure\" information by hiding it rather than facilitating getting the right information to the right users. Instead, we worked together covering information security & privacy as a team rather than playing the foolish security vs. privacy or privacy vs. security game. In short, Mark is a business leader as well as a technical specialist & that makes all the difference to me.”"

My work focuses on the intersection of healthcare and technology - a passion I’m fortunate to pursue both professionally and personally. I often say I’m lucky enough to spend my weekdays working on the same things that I explore on weekends: Healthcare, Technology, Product Management, and Leadership. I specialize in supporting clients on projects with strong digital and technological components in healthcare, focusing on payers and providers, and navigating complex environments to deliver impact. With a background in engineering and technology, I bring a practical, hands-on approach to problem-solving, helping clients drive results in multidisciplinary team settings. My ability to communicate effectively across diverse disciplines ensures that solutions are innovative, actionable, and widely embraced. Outside of client work, I am passionate about recruiting, training, and mentoring the next generation of consultants at BCG. A particular focus of mine is helping teams harness the power of Generative AI to enhance the quality and efficiency of their work, setting them up for long-term success in an ever changing landscape. Beyond work, you’ll often find me in the kitchen trying out new recipes, on the trail running, or hitting the slopes for a day of skiing.",

I began my career in Washington, D.C. as an Associate with Boston Consulting Group, starting in January 2024. Post-grad, I traveled for 4 months through twenty countries in Europe and Northern Africa. I possess an intense dedication to self-development and am eager to dive into my industries of interest (including Travel & Tourism, Retail/Consumer, Real Estate, Start-Ups, Technology, Education, and Publishing) and begin a career with meaning through purposeful work that aligns with my desire to reinvent around me for the good of clients, my communities, and make progress towards a more efficient & content world. I believe that nothing should be done a certain way solely because that was how it was done previously, but believe that we should utilize the knowledge and practices that have been built before us which allow us to succeed quicker than we can alone. Whether it is pitching a business plan, creating a product prototype, laying out a multi-sheet Excel model, or writing a novel: I always come with fresh ideas and energy.

              "description": "Distributed energy resources (DER) companies have emerged as a real force in thepower industry. Recent advances in battery storage, smart-home technology, andenergy management devices, as well as a growing thirst for green energy amongcustomers and policymakers, are making DER an attractive alternative to traditional grid distribution and meter-based systems.The M&A WayTo take advantage of the opportunity that DER holds—the market is growing bydouble digits annually—incumbents would be wise to pursue acquisitions of DERcompanies. Although expanding, the DER segment is still immature and fragmented, populated by numerous small startups. Established utilities have a wide varietyof potential partners with which to enter the market quickly.First-Mover AdvantagesPower companies that strike first to increase scale, expand DER R&D, and developnew skill sets in DER applications can rapidly realize a competitive edge. By bringing the latest technology and a lean cost structure to the DER market, incumbentscould gain first-mover advantages and become dominant in a segment that promises to become as palatable to consumers as the traditional power segment is today."

            "Tom Adams “Four years ago, AWS and BCG embarked on building our partnership. Over that time Jack has been an instrumental part of building our AWS – BCG relationship across all levels. Jack’s vision, drive, and tenacity to chart the course, develop our network, and drive to business outcomes which are the foundations of our collaboration. The world-class ecosystem, program, and team he has built along with driving the shift within BCG to embrace and engage a diverse partner ecosystem in such a short time has been amazing. Jack is an experienced leader that knows how to engage stakeholders across extraordinarily diverse and complex teams and have them focus on what matters most. His intellect, business sense, and positive attitude have enabled not only remarkable progress to-date, but will inform and fuel our future opportunities together. I truly appreciate Jack’s leadership and contributions, and look forward to continuing to work with him and his team.”",
            "Dan Martines “Jack joined BCG four years ago to establish our partner program and team, and I have witnessed remarkable progress ever since. Despite the relatively short time, Jack has successfully integrated, evolved, and spearheaded transformative changes that enable BCG to actively engage our world-class alliance ecosystem. This ecosystem plays a vital role in uncovering and unlocking fresh opportunities for both BCG and our clients, bolstering our brand, and nurturing our talent. Working closely with Jack and his team within this alliance ecosystem has been an invaluable experience for us. It not only informs our decisions but also fuels our aspirations for the future. I truly appreciate Jack's contributions and leadership. Thank you, Jack!”"

I began my career in Washington, D.C. as an Associate with Boston Consulting Group, starting in January 2024. Post-grad, I traveled for 4 months through twenty countries in Europe and Northern Africa. I possess an intense dedication to self-development and am eager to dive into my industries of interest (including Travel & Tourism, Retail/Consumer, Real Estate, Start-Ups, Technology, Education, and Publishing) and begin a career with meaning through purposeful work that aligns with my desire to reinvent around me for the good of clients, my communities, and make progress towards a more efficient & content world. I believe that nothing should be done a certain way solely because that was how it was done previously, but believe that we should utilize the knowledge and practices that have been built before us which allow us to succeed quicker than we can alone. Whether it is pitching a business plan, creating a product prototype, laying out a multi-sheet Excel model, or writing a novel: I always come with fresh ideas and energy.

My work focuses on the intersection of healthcare and technology - a passion I’m fortunate to pursue both professionally and personally. I often say I’m lucky enough to spend my weekdays working on the same things that I explore on weekends: Healthcare, Technology, Product Management, and Leadership. I specialize in supporting clients on projects with strong digital and technological components in healthcare, focusing on payers and providers, and navigating complex environments to deliver impact. With a background in engineering and technology, I bring a practical, hands-on approach to problem-solving, helping clients drive results in multidisciplinary team settings. My ability to communicate effectively across diverse disciplines ensures that solutions are innovative, actionable, and widely embraced. Outside of client work, I am passionate about recruiting, training, and mentoring the next generation of consultants at BCG. A particular focus of mine is helping teams harness the power of Generative AI to enhance the quality and efficiency of their work, setting them up for long-term success in an ever changing landscape. Beyond work, you’ll often find me in the kitchen trying out new recipes, on the trail running, or hitting the slopes for a day of skiing.",

She served as the student body president and in that role she was a champion for several important initiatives that improved student life, including our support for families and inclusion within our community. She took a wide view of the student experience, working to improve student life and our community culture from orientation to commencement. Her leadership inspired her team to both innovated and execute on those initiatives.”",
            "Alina Clark “Emily is driven by her curiosity, passion and good sense of humor. I worked side by side with Emily on a global strategy project and she immediately made a great first impression: a self-starter, able to see short term little wins while keeping an eye on the long term success. Emily strives in a team of people who are highly collaborative and focused on impacting the business in a positive way. She takes the lead and follows through consistently and goes above and beyond where she sees there is an opportunity to take things further. Emily’s positive energy is contagious so she is a great addition to a team. ”"

I've had the pleasure of working with Elisabeth for half a year at Flamingo, and I've been so impressed at her ability to learn, adapt and lead so quickly. On top of this, she's simply a a lovely human - very caring, compassionate and kind. This makes working with her an ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. She has a wealth of experience within the beauty space, but is very agile and can apply her smarts across any category including alcohol & technology. It would be my pleasure to give any potential current or future employer a more specific reference. Roxanne ”"

              "description": "Topology optimization approaches for thermal transport problems generally rely on the presence of high contrast in thermal conductivity between constituent materials. Even though this might result in topo- logical configurations that are optimal according to some desired thermal metric, the resulting systems might be impractical from a mechanical standpoint: high contrast in thermal conductivity generally translates into disparate ranges of thermal expansion, which in turn may lead to mechanical failure. In this paper, we focus on the combination of multi-scale modeling and topology optimization techniques for the design of polycrystalline single-material systems with enhanced thermal transport properties. Spatial variation of the length-dependent thermal conductivity is achieved by grading the characteristic grain size of the microstructure. We adopt a multi-scale approach to compute the attainable range of thermal conductivity due to grain-size effect, given maximum and minimum grain sizes and an operating temperature range. Then, we utilize an adaptive topology optimization technique to obtain an optimal grain size distribution, while accounting for manufacturing constraints. Through a series of specific examples, we demonstrate the extent to which thermal transport properties can be optimized without resorting to the adoption of multi-material systems."

At the sub-grain level, we compute the values of the thermal conductivity tensor using the Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. At the continuum level, the polycrystalline structure of the specimen is resolved explicitly by a finite element mesh and the texture of the polycrystal is assumed to be given. At this level, we adopt a Fourier model of heat conduction which utilizes values of thermal conductivity obtained at the lower scale. The mechanical response of the grains is modeled as elastic and anisotropic. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated through a series of examples, which highlight the potential of our approach for designing materials with improved thermomechanical response."

It enables new products and services. It opens up opportunities to create personalized offers and provide bespoke services to many more customers. Its distribution channels widen the playing field for luxury brands, allowing them to reach consumers not reached before and to engage with customers online in markets where a brand has no stores. In the US alone, consumers anticipate spending 20% to 35% of their total outlays online in the next few years, according to research by The Boston Consulting Group. (See The Reciprocity Principle: How Millennials Are Changing the Face of Marketing Forever, BCG Focus, January 2014.)But not all brands are there yet. In fact, luxury lags other consumer sectors when it comes to understanding and applying digital technologies. Disney, Nike, Nordstrom—these are just a handful of the household names that have mastered digital. For more than a few luxury brands, then, the issue really is do or die: the speed of technology development is endangering their current business models faster than you can say “celebrity-chef-catered safari.”"

The intent of the CFDA study undertaken with The Boston Consulting Group in January was to question the status quo for our market, stimulate a dialogue in the American fashion industry and move towards long-term solutions together.The unanimous consensus among our interviewees: the time is ripe for change in our market. ‘In-season relevancy’ emerged as a recurring idea. Beyond fashion shows, the delivery cycle and subsequent markdown cadence at retail emerged as a critical issue that needs to be addressed in our market to better match the actual, physical season and our consumers’ behaviors and needs.

It is perhaps more important that this generation is transforming consumer marketing itself.Millennials engage with brands more personally, extensively and emotionally than do older consumers, and social media and mobile devices greatly amplify their feedback.Millennials also expect a reciprocal, two-way relationship with companies, and want brands to reflect their values. We call this the reciprocity principle.Companies can expect that a positive brand experience will prompt Millennials to take favorable public action on behalf of their brand. A bad—or even just disappointing—experience can turn a Millennial into a vocal critic who will spread the negative word through social media, reviews, and blogs.In marketing, as in pop culture, Millennials are leading indicators of large-scale changes in future consumer behavior. As a result, this generational transition is ushering in the end of consumer marketing as we have long known it. The good old rational, linear \"push\" approach to marketing will never be the same again.If they have not already begun to do so, companies must make marketing to Millennials a top strategic priority and begin to master the art of two-way reciprocal marketing. Companies are already finding that pushing consistent, prepackaged brand messages to the masses through traditional media is not as effective and cost efficient as it once was—certainly not with Millennials, nor increasingly with Gen-Xers and boomers."

Working with Palm is less \"explaining\" and more collaboration and teaming. I find Palm to be working at a higher level than expected for his rank. He also stays ahead of his assignments rather than waiting to be directed. He works quickly without a loss in quality, and is willing to go the extra mile(s) to get the job done. Highly recommended Palm!”"

          "about": "I currently lead Administrative Services for BCG Nexus Atlanta, Nexus Costa Rica and Dallas. With 30 years at BCG, I started as production assistant before moving into EA and then Senior EA role supported J. Puckett (Managing Director and Senior Partner). J. founded our firm's global education practice and is Global leader of BCG U, the firm's upskilling, reskilling, and talent development offering.. While supporting J., I also managed several teams within BCG’s South System and have worked with many other BCG partners over my career. Prior to joining BCG, I worked for Morrison Knudsen Engineering. I have a passion for the EA role and the value it brings to organizations. I am a co-author of The Heart of CEO Effectiveness, which reinforces the value and impact the EA role has within an organization. I've written several LinkedIn articles regarding EA role, running and team building. I am also thankful to have my writing that captured my Boston Marathon 2018 running experience highlighted in the Boston Buddies book alongside incredible women like Katherine Switzer and Sarah Sellers, who are an inspiration to me and many others. I am blessed with the chaos of 4 wonderful children and an amazing husband for over 30 years. In my spare time, I’m and avid runner. I've successfully completed Dallas, BCS, United States Air Force Marathon, San Antonio, Louisiana 2016 & 2018, Boston 2017 & 2018, and Joplin. I'm looking forward to more adventures to come!",

The weather forecast called for 38-degree temperatures, two inches of rain, a sustained 15 to 25 miles per hour head wind, and a real feel temperature below freezing. But that was nothing compared to the challenges that many of these runners faced on their journey to the start line. Cancer, ALS, HIV, autism, and divorce are some of the challenges you’ll read about that these runners had to overcome to be able to participate in one of the most prestigious marathons in the world. No one was going to let the weather stand in their way of running a race that meant so much to them in their own unique way."

            "Ed Moore “I had the pleasure of working with Linda for the five years I headed up Internal Audit at Iron Mountain. Linda was a very dynamic leader who took a broad interest in supporting the key initiatives and objectives of the company. Linda essentially developed a strategy for significantly increasing and expanding the remit of the procurement organisation by building very strong relationships with her key stakeholders and hiring very capable and talented resources. She won over some initially skeptical stakeholders who had been used to making their own procurement decisions by listening to their concerns and then demonstrating the added value she and her team could bring toward the management of key supplier relationships. Linda quickly developed a solid reputation as a talented negotiator for the company as well developing a model that excelled at executing against key strategic initiatives. Linda was able to save the company signficant costs while increasing the value of supplier relationships at the same time. I truly appreciated Linda's efforts throughout my time at IRM as she consistently supported risk mitigation strategies and was a very strong advocate for the strengthening internal controls when it was appropriate. I truly believe Linda could add significant value in this area for any company that is looking to improve its procurement and supplier relationships.”",
            "Rob Reynolds “Linda is an experienced sourcing and procurement executive and a valued business partner who delivers results. We have collaborated on many initiatives and I value her knowledge, expertise, and ability to listen and solve real business challenges. Linda is a true professional who drives results not just through her organization but by driving alignment via providing valuable insights to the business. She is a talented executive who excels at building a highly functioning organization with emphasis on collaboration and business partnership. In a short period of time she transformed our procurement organization into a value add organization and expanded the remit to a true global platform. Amazing leader and great evaluator of talent who understands the value of an engaged team. Absolute pleasure to work with.”"

Unfortunately, with strong competition for limited funding, Procurement teams often are often unable to gain access to the investment necessary to deliver this untapped value. There is no single answer in solving these concerns, as each company has their own revenue and expense priorities to navigate. All that being said, there are some effective levers that procurement functions can tap in order to enable strategic improvements."

              "description": "Studies demonstrate a positive correlation between favorable health outcomes (i.e. patients achieving and sustaining good health) and patients who are engaged with managing their care plan. The advancement and adoption of IT solutions in the health delivery setting has empowered providers to communicate health information with other providers and patients themselves. Patient portals have become the standard health information technology (HIT) tool for engaging patients with their care. As a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) compliant tool, patient portals have allowed providers to share health information with patients without restraints. However, patient portals have many improvement opportunities in order to truly engage patient with their care. In a broad perspective, there is need for a bi-directional interaction between patients and providers. This paper identifies key issues that have contributed to the dissatisfaction associated with patient portals and requirements that would effectively address these issues. Moreover, this proposal will discuss how an alternate web-based solution can engage a high-risk patient population, diabetics, through functions that will empower patients to manage their health, interact with multiple providers, and benefit from provider outreach efforts.Keywords: patient portal, diabetes, patient engagement, web-based, health IT, healthcare access"

            "Dr. Sebastian Gohr “I worked with Justine on a data analytics projects, which involved some heavy data structure building that she was overseeing. Justine's contributions were outstanding, she quickly understands issues/topics from both a technical and a stakeholder-view perspective, adjusts priorities to expected impact, and knows whom to leverage when. She demonstrated smart creativity in problem solving, not just following brute-force approaches, all with an admirable \"get-the-job-done right\" mentality. Justine is the right person to connect the dots of a (t)ask and identify suitable solutions that match the stakeholder's actual business needs. Thank you for your efforts and the great team collaboration, it was a pleasure! I'd always work again with Justine as Project Manager. Any project, any time!”",
            "George Lloyd “I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Justine Watt over the last five years. During that time I have come to know Justine as smart, compassionate, driven, focused, fearless and collaborative. From scoping a case to driving a team toward a common goal, she is always quick as a whip, asking probing questions that help to lead to the most logical conclusions. Despite her work ethic and ‘client first’ mentality, she always considers the unique circumstances of every team player and is the first to appropriately recognize and advocate for work/life balance for the members of her team. As an individual contributor and as a team lead, once on a case, she tunes a laser focus on the task at hand and is always playing a key role in driving to the end goal. Justine is fearless of any task put before her, diving right into the mix without hesitation. That said, she is the first to ensure that all stakeholders and team member perspectives are allowed a forum for consideration in a truly collaborative fashion. Justine is a talented team leader, and I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to partner with her over these years. Sincerely, George Lloyd”"

I am passionate about advancing the Diversity & Inclusion agenda and helping coach and mentor others as I have been myself. Before BCG, I worked at Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Cornerstone Research. I received my BA in Mathematics (Magna Cum Laude and with distinction in the Major) from Yale University and my MBA from Harvard Business School.

Without intervention, travel and tourism emissions will grow by 5% annually, to 8.4 gigatons of CO2 emissions in 2030. To reduce the industry’s carbon footprint, travel and tourism companies must persuade consumers to make more sustainable travel choices. That’s a daunting task: In travel and tourism, relative to other categories, the number of macrochoices (a green class of service, for example) and microchoices (choosing local products) that consumers face is particularly vast, and these choices often come with unique nuances.To effect change among consumers, companies should follow a three-step process: understand the drivers of choice, innovate to create sustainable offerings, and promote sustainable choices."

The combination of exploding data from internal and external sources, and a stronger focus on value and outcomes, has reshaped the requirements and expectations for drug development and commercialization businesses.The fast-evolving health care landscape is lifting the importance of medical affairs at biopharma companies, necessitating leaders to rethink the capabilities, talent, metrics, and focus they bring to their jobs. As a number of high-impact trends accelerate in the coming years, the opportunity for medical affairs functions to play a more active and influential role both internally and externally will increase.In Vivo explores the overarching themes and questions from a roundtable discussion among senior medical affairs leaders from 14 top biopharma companies. The session was facilitated by The Boston Consulting Group and supported by surveys and interviews with larger groups of medical affairs leaders and professionals."

I am a core member of the firm’s Energy practice leadership and Chair of BCG's Center for Energy Impact. Throughout my career, I have helped leading public and private sector companies in the oil, gas, power, and renewables sectors, with advice spanning the full energy value chain from the energy source through to the end consumer. I help my clients identify solutions to some of the most pertinent strategic challenges. My passions are to define innovative solutions and leverage opportunities that arise from energy transition, digital approaches, and value chain integration to create future shareholder value. I actively develop opportunities for networking and professional development within the industry, where I facilitate CEO and senior leadership dialogue and engage with media, universities, and external conferences to share my insights. Before joining BCG, I worked with an independent energy trader in Germany and spent several years with Wintershall in Argentina. While at Wintershall, I worked in oil and gas marketing and later in business development, including planning and commercial implementation of LPG and pipeline projects. I earned an MBA in Finance from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, where I was a Palmer Scholar (top 5% of class). I earned a BA from Duke University (magna cum laude).",

The market conditions that create the boom will also compress its path—with surging demand coinciding with a shortage of supply—and the price expansion will not last long. Despite the boom’s relatively short duration, producers and users of oil will need to plan ahead to tap opportunities to prepare for a postpandemic, lower-carbon era and mitigate the risks of higher prices."
