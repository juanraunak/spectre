          "about": "Hey there. If I were to choose one thing to represent who I am, it would be a \"water droplet.\" The most stable form of water is a droplet and it still adopts the shape of the container it lives in and fits in seamlessly with the environment. I thrive on connecting with those around me, as I steadily learn, change, and discover myself a little more every day. I value opportunities to collaborate with enthusiastic individuals toward a common objective. I am currently an AI Product Manager at Oracle. I recently moved from India to the US for this role. As a part of my job, I am responsible for designing and managing Artificial Intelligence Solutions for an enterprise platform for hotel operations and distribution. My professional experience has exposed me to the importance of Personal Branding for professionals and I am passionate about sharing my ideas on the topic with everyone. I host a podcast, \"Personal Branding for Professionals, \" which shares career development strategies to help professionals build a successful career in tech. Today, the podcast serves as a career development resource for over 7000 professionals. As a woman in STEM, I am aware of the fact that the number of women in these fields still makes up only a fraction of the total workforce. I am involved in various initiatives that address the gender gap (and gender discrimination in some cases). I want every girl, in every corner of the world, to be given the chance to explore STEM, so that they can be a part of this empowering journey. For instance, my work with initiatives like Women in Data Science has given me a holistic perspective to create an inclusive space for women while addressing the barriers they face in the tech industry. I have also been featured in the Entrepreneur Magazine and the 1 Million Women in STEM campaign. I dedicate my weekends to mentoring professionals who want to break into product/tech. In 2022, I mentored over 100+ college graduates and professionals in landing their desired job roles and boosting visibility at work. I have found my voice by delivering talks on \"Product Management\" and \"Personal Branding for Career Growth\" at about 15 conferences/podcasts so far. These include prestigious conferences like the WomenTech Global Network Conference (which unites 100,000 women in tech to drive impact) and the Product World 2023 conference (the world’s largest Product Manager Conference). I enjoy finding opportunities to connect and would love to connect with you! Feel free to reach out to me. If you have a speaking opportunity for me, please DM me.",

I was born to be a promoter, teacher and marketer. This has led me to various roles in business development throughout my career; sometimes working for visionaries in exciting and challenging roles, and other times starting new businesses with folks much smarter than myself. I have been involved in unique business projects since 1987. I have lived and worked in the USA, The Netherlands, Mexico, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Canada and have been lucky to participate in team projects in more than 20 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia. I have consulted with and worked for captains of industry, local chieftains, and peasant farmers (literally). While I am classically trained in international relations and law, I believe my best skills were learned \"on the job\". I bring these skills to each new project I am fortunate enough to work on. I am an equal opportunity networker.",

            "Sean Russell “I eagerly await what I know will be fantastic results from what Scott Charter and Mike Hollander will be able to produce for their clients at Mod Mission Critical. While reporting directly to Scott and Mike at WBS Connect, I was able to take my data networking and colocation skills up to entirely new levels. Through education, coaching and while closing business together, I was able to learn and experience things that one could never encounter by working for a large carrier. I have worked for many of the best and largest carriers in the world and the skills and experience I gained while at WBS Connect have benefited me greatly. I know that Mod Mission Critical will build upon the great success they had at WBS Connect and will truly be able to offer their clients a vast array of products and services that will be difficult to duplicate.”",

I have watched Scott's various successes over the years with envy and admiration. I always watch what Scott is working on because he seems to have a keen insight on opportunity combined with the ability to execute.”"

In addition, I have not meant any Director who demonstrates the strong technical aptitude and problem-solving skills as Jenny. She focuses on the good of the whole, and her word is as good as gold. I am fortunate to have the opportunity to grow professionally under her wings.”"

            "Thomas Hughes “Strategic, visionary, change agent, transformational, inspirational, and empowering are just a few of the terms that I use to describe Sovan Shatpathy. I had the opportunity to work with Sovan when he recruited me to join his team at Navy Federal Credit Union as he began to rebuild the Product Engineering and Delivery Services group. I could not have been more impressed with his depth of technical knowledge and his leadership abilities to drive enterprise-wide change. Sovan is one of the rare leaders who can establish a compelling vision for the future, build mindshare with his stakeholders, and then flawlessly deliver. Sovan seamlessly builds solid teams, he has the innate ability to bring together leaders with diverse backgrounds, skills and leadership styles and transform them into high performing teams. His empathy-led approach to developing talent creates an atmosphere where team members at all levels can grow, achieve, and thrive. He respects the perspectives of others and welcomes new ideas and innovations. It was an absolute honor and pleasure to have worked with Sovan. He embodies all of the traits of successful leadership, and any organization would be incredibly fortunate to have him as part of their senior leadership team. Sovan is one of the finest leaders that I have worked for in my career. I am very grateful for his mentorship and friendship.”",
            "Bruce Rebhan “Sovan possesses a rare and impressive combination of abilities; he’s one of the best. He can set strategy, processes and architecture to enable a high-value future state. He understands the key levers for ROI in financial services companies, and his industry expertise directly informs his approach to technology. He is also very effective at delivering on his vision, driving execution at scale and across many domains at once. He helps his teams plan around required timelines and dependencies, and when roadblocks arise he is always in the trenches to find a solution. Sovan is a strong leader and manager of his teams. He aligns everyone to a shared vision for change- easy to say and damned difficult to do. He is particularly good at assembling diverse teams of individuals with complementary strengths, establishing roles that allow his people to thrive. Sovan can adroitly navigate complexity, both technical and organizational. He can explain complex technology to non-technical audiences, ensuring buy-in from top to bottom. He is an elite agent of change, and it was fun to be on these journeys with him. ”"

Neil is great company and great to work with; he's incredibly gregarious and personable, knowledgeable about his areas of expertise, and superb in front of customers.

They always left smarter and laughing which is not an easy feet. He is one of the best in the biz.”",
            "Andrew Binstock “During Fritz's tenure at CMP (later UBM), he has been involved in so many acquisitions and projects that his fingerprints are pretty much everywhere on the editorial side of the house. Most notable, though, has been his role driving the digital media strategy. He was the earliest to understand the central importance of video to media sites, champion investment in it, and drive websites to integrate video offerings. Fritz also showed us how good video reporting is done with countless interviews, ranging from purely informative pieces, to feisty interviews with CEOs, to hosting Valley View, a regular monthly production featuring notable start-ups in Silicon Valley. The latter show, like much of Fritz's many written columns, displayed his acerbic wit and the ability to quickly seize upon important details and make them understandable to his audience. Few people I've met so quickly understand new information in the context of what an audience needs to know--and as a result his video work at UBM has been tremendously enriching both in itself and as an example to all of us.”"

            "LinkedIn User “I've worked with Tirthankar several times during my time at Oracle. Our last collaboration was on Oracle Exalytics where his product (Oracle TimesTen) was the in-memory database powering the system. Tirthankar is a fantastic leader with the perfect blend of technical and leadership skills. To support Exalytics his team built out a number of critical features ranging from complex features (Compression, Analytic functions etc) to smaller but equally critical bug fixes. Delivering this under a tight schedule and balancing other commitments required a leader of enormous ability and judgement and Tirthankar really shone in that role. I would happily work with/for him at any time.”",
            "Benjamin C. Chang, CISSP “Tirthankar's kernel development groups were always well-managed, delivered on time, and quite productive. He himself came up through the development ranks, thus he was up-to-date and quite proficient with the code. In the kernel group at Oracle, those in management were still very technical. In terms of a work colleague, he was always ready with a smile and looked at the glass half-full. Quite enjoyable to work with!”"

The KPIs and KRAs are very clear and transparent. The trainings and meetings conducted by Jim motivated the entire team and provided the right direction. In my 22-year career, I have never seen a leader like Jim, who helped me get motivated and work for a reason. Thank you so much, Jim, for your Leadership and Mentoring.”",
            "Christopher Ferrari “Jim Hawkins is one of those rare leaders that leaves a lifelong impression for those that have had the pleasure of working with him. Throughout his tenure and Rackspace, Jim has provided technical and strategic vision that led to many enterprise deals that shaped Rackspace's growth. He has been vital to improving our service platform and building efficiencies in our global data center portfolio. Jim has been an inspirational leader. His thought-provoking concepts around taking ownership and being a humble and credible leader have had a tremendous influence on me. He can lead while making you feel that you are truly valued and that you have a say in how things get done. Jim doesn’t just get my highest recommendation, but he has earned my deep appreciation and respect for all he has done to support me and my organization throughout the years. ”"

Cassie knows in her heart that she's more grown up than everyone gives her credit for and can make her own decisions about what's right and wrong, and who's good or evil. Will Cassie's choices be good for the Madrona Heroes, or will she put her friends and siblings in more danger than ever before?

If there’s one thing the previous year taught Zach, it’s that keeping his feelings inside is the best course of action. But when Zach runs into Zoe, a new girl in the neighborhood, things get even more complicated. Zoe seems to have a super power and is very concerned about a rash of cases of neighborhood pets getting hurt or going missing. Oh, and one more thing, Zach thinks Zoe is impossibly beautiful. The more the Jordan kids and their friends investigate the missing pets, the more they find out that the story of their superpowers is even more tangled and dangerous than they ever suspected. Zach is doing everything he can to keep the neighborhood animals safe, and the kids’ powers a secret, but can he keep his own feelings safe and secret in the process?"

            "Pedro Luis Voyer “Pablo and I met during an event for MBA hires at Microsoft during my first month of working there. His story caught my attention as he is a Hispanic leader in tech, coming from a background similar to mine. I approached him to ask for some time to connect and to my surprise he gave me the opportunity to meet regularly. Over the course of the last year and a half, Pablo has been a valuable mentor to me. He has helped me learn how to be successful in tech sales, coached me on how to build my personal brand, and given me advice on how to navigate this new stage of life. During a year where he took paternity leave and was stretched thin, Pablo coached me through my pivot from Dynamics to Azure. He continues to challenge me and take interest in my development. I can say that Pablo has been fundamental to my development at Microsoft, and look forward to the day that I can earn a spot on his team. ”",
            "Jorge Chavez “I had to chance to work with Pablo when we has fresh out of school and have mentored him over the years. It is very satisfying to see the evolution of a great college recruit into a fantastic sales executive. I'm especially impressed to see him be equally successful in Mexico, across Latin America and today in a worldwide role based in the US. This just goes to show his personal and professional maturity and savviness. Great teams are made of people with great character and Pablo certainly has a lot of it.”"

            "Eileen Brooker “I have worked with some pretty amazing people in my career but Jeff Welsch really is one of the brightest and most gifted. He has a true gift of understanding all the facets of a situation (not just the technical) and relaying it in terms that others can easiliy understand and act upon. I have seen him in a management role where he had to manage/support a very large SE team as well as in a global strategic role where he had to build something from scratch. In both instances, he has contributed such value to the organization and through this, the different resources within the company have been armed with solid business justification and explanation to enter new markets, form new strategies or build new solutions. Jeff cares about his work and goes the extra mile to make sure that all areas are covered, researched and provide value. His skill set is really one that is rare and would be considered to be such a value to anyone that is lucky enough to work along side him, for him or in support of him. I hope that i get to continue to work with Jeff as it is very fun to watch him in his element!”",
            "Scott Safe “Jeff has very indepth experience in networking. Excellent communicator - able to translate complex product value in meaningful benefits for the customer. Quickly grasps what competitors do and do not do, and able to win the deal with this knowledge. Very few times did Jeff lose - and when he did, issues were outside of his control. A leader in the technical organization. Partners and customers very frequently seek out his technical guidance and advice. Able to easily find complementary products and solutions to win those tough deals that are beyond our product value. I highly recommend Jeff.”"

With over 27 years of service at Oracle, Chris has made successful contributions across multiple areas in the organization, including leading the company's efforts to recruit and support veterans in the workforce. As a fellow veteran who served in the US Army, Chris has dedicated his civilian life to helping other veterans find meaningful employment and succeed in their careers. During his time at Oracle, Chris served as the Chair of the Military Affiliated Veteran Employee Network (MAVEN) Employee Resource Group (ERG), and under his leadership, the Oracle Veterans Program has become one of the most successful initiatives of its kind, providing resources and support to veterans, military spouses, families, friends, and allies. Chris's work is truly inspiring, and he is a role model for anyone looking to make a positive impact in the world. As someone who has had the opportunity to work with Chris, I am proud to do so and greatly admire his leadership, which has had an outstanding impact on both the Oracle organization, the veteran community, and myself.”",

            "Glenn Goodrich “I first met Nick when he joined GoldenGate Software. Nick was taking the lead Product Management position for the real-time enterprise data replication product, GoldenGate, with his primary focus on support for Oracle. Prior to joining GoldenGate, Nick has a PM role with a similar product, Quest from Shareplex which is now owned by Dell. At that time I was the Sr. Manager of Education Services, Documentation, and Courseware Development. We worked closely together in many facets. When Oracle acquired GoldenGate, we worked even closer as my role evolved to a Product Manager position. Besides working on the product lifecycle, we also spent a good amount of time working with customers at marketing events, trade shows, customer advisory meetings, and user conferences. I have great respect for Nick’s work ethic and friendship. He is very knowledgeable about Oracle’s replication technology and solutions in data integration. Nick works well with many levels including top sales leaders, developers, QA, support, and in both calm and stressful situations. He would works well as both a leader and individual contributor. If you are looking for someone that can wear many hats; create technical and customer-facing white papers or data sheets, articulate the business value of our integration solutions with lectures and presentations, or simply get on a call with a customer to be an product evangelist, he would be perfect.”",
            "Chris McAllister “I worked with Nick as a PM during my entire tenure at GoldenGate and Oracle. I have an incredible amount of respect for Nick's professionalism, work ethic and camaraderie. At times we were the only two PMs and we worked well together and am very proud of what we accomplished. Nick is one of the most knowledgeable on our product especially within the Oracle environment. He has a great demeanor in very stressful situations. Nick also is a great PM with the ability to effectively schedule the most important features with the typically limited development resources. He is a very good product evangelist and works very well with the sales and development teams. I would not hesitate if you are looking for a PM with deep technical knowledge and excellent communication skills.”"

We both just wanted to \"do something\" already - and with NewsiT I am. He is a much valued mentor and advisor to me and my new company.”",
            "Chris Giovanniello “Brad has an amazing aptitude for jumping in to a complicated business environment, with challenging relationships and complex technology, and in like a nanosecond, \"just simply getting it\". While working in Europe as a regional manager, I had the pleasure of working with Brad, who supported me from headquarters. Within weeks he had networked his way through our entire organization, to come up to speed on all the issues and find the people with the answers that he needed to make himself extremely effective. As a result, he was immediately helpful to me and to my customer. He has a fantastic vision and perspective that can help anyone who needs to understand the essence of a new business opportunity.”"

Through my own journey, I've come to realize that finding a job is the easy part. Finding the right job, organization, and re-discovering yourself in the process is what's hard. That's why I am dedicated to guiding veterans and spouses towards self-discovery, what you want to do, and how to get there. The job will come. What do I do at Oracle? With my bachelor's and master's degrees, coupled with my professional background, I draw upon my expertise to develop and implement transformative programs and processes to source, recruit, and retain talented veterans and military spouses. I'm honored to contribute to a greater mission aimed at fostering a workplace culture grounded in inclusion, belonging, and profound respect for every individual. I crave collaborative environments that allow innovation, creativity, and excellence, which is why building relationships that impact results on an individual and corporate level are my favorite aspect of what I do. Secondly, storytelling is important. While interviewing and job seeking can be daunting, I believe it's a way to share your unique story. As you transition and re-discover yourself, Please count on me to help share your narrative.",

            "Owen Frederick “Mindy has been nothing short of amazing during my transition from active duty military service. I have come across so many people over the past year who claim to be military friendly mentors, recruiters, etc. but almost all of them have turned out to be frauds who are only interested in serving themselves. Mindy had literally been the exception. She has been caring, dedicated, and professional from our very first interaction. Not only is she a hero for her service and dedication to this country, but she is a true hero to me. Mindy is the embodiment of what recruitment should be and what “military friendly” should actually mean to the thousands of service members transitioning regularly. Mindy, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for everything you have done for me. To summarize my experience working with Mindy, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel\" - Maya Angelou”",
            "George del Hierro, MBA, PhD “Mindy led a three-part student Veterans workshop at Chapman University. She proved herself to be a diligent, passionate, knowledgeable expert and leader in the field and we were grateful to have her. She possessed a unique ability to connect with audience members and inspire them to take action on their careers. Within each session, students gained first-hand information on how to leverage their military education, training, and experiences into their civilian career pathways. Words can’t express the impact she made on Chapman students in such a short amount of time. Thank you, Mindy!! George del Hierro”"

Under his guidance, be it a product or a team, you can always be confident you are doing the right thing. Nobody can drive/manage cross-functional/product teams the way he does. It don’t matter if the team is big or small, he knows what’s happening where and the best thing is, he is always around when there’s help required. He simply gets things done; he is a deliverer and a decision maker! He is a remarkable technical architect and can get into the bottom line of the code if he must. His knowledge and understanding of a product in all aspects is commendable; he is a holistic viewer of a situation. He can take up any role within the team and be that one guy that turns things around. He has been mighty consistent in demonstrating his character; his dedication and passion. I owe him my heartfelt gratitude and am always thankful to him not only for being a leader and the kind of person he was, but for bringing out the best in me, something I never imagined I could ever do. He is one of the greatest reasons I am successful and happy at what I am doing today. You are a game changer, George! It’s a privilege to have worked with you.”",

His management experience in multiple areas at one time is astounding. He has continuously achieved success during his tenure with great cross-functional team work that provided many benefits and was a powerful and effective solution for an array of workplace obstacles. He would provide any organization with amazing senior leadership and I would fully recommend him without any reservation for anything in a senior management role.”"

            "Nard Linders “For someone who’s recognized as one of the ‘founding fathers’ within the Marketing Automation space, Stephen doesn’t require much of an introduction, let alone a recommendation. For the last few years, I have witnessed Stephen shape and execute a laser sharp vision that helped the Eloqua platform move into the absolute #1 position with top-leadership ratings across all major analyst reports. Stephen introduced and transformed a concept that now acts as the ‘gold standard’ within the industry. Besides his ability to shape vision and build ground breaking products, Stephen never loses touch with his team and the people around him. He can switch gears from strategic product discussions, tactical sprint planning, or personal one-to-one conversations. You’ll never catch Stephen off guard. Just make sure you’re ready for him to slip in a joke or two... It’s been a pleasure working on Stephen's team, and any organization would be very lucky to have him on-board. ”",
            "Beth Burns “Stephen does an excellent job of creating the exciting vision for Oracle's marketing technology, while balancing the immediate needs of customers. He miraculously manages to shift easily between high level strategic conversations and discussions about the most minute level of technical detail. Not sure how he does it! Stephen is responsive, personable and a complete team player. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past 3 years.”"

Throughout the process, Samir continued to impress my team and I with his patience, knowledge, eagerness to help and genuine interest in the outcome. He came to every meeting fully prepared and had educated himself about our company and soon came to be viewed as “one of us.” Through his efforts and guidance, a huge decision and investment for our company became a “no-brainer.” He also seems to be a genuinely good person. I highly recommend Samir, as he would be a valuable asset to any company. Thank you, Samir, and best of luck to you!”",
            "LinkedIn User “Samir and delivering results (for clients and his organization) go hand in hand. Working with Samir as my Solution Partner at Forrester, it was imperative that I have a partner who could help me take big ideas & complex client asks, and translate them into something that our clients could easily understand, believe in, and get behind. Samir has a unique ability to build client stakeholder trust with his clear/simple presentation of complex solutions, warm personality, and building consensus around the desired outcomes of working together - but even more importantly, he then delivers. I had some of my most successful years working with Samir, and I know my clients did as well, so I know that wherever he goes, success (for all) will surely follow. Samir come highly recommended!”"

As the leader of an organization, I am guided by two principle objectives: 1) Build a shared vision that guides the actions of every member of the organization and allows people closest to the problem to be solved to make decisions 2) Create a culture that drives out fear and encourages the key traits I started with above.

            "Jim Nippes “Kip and I have known each other since our early days at Hewlett-Packard. We were both colleges hires, Kip from Berkeley and I from Stanford. Outside of the obvious rivalry we came to respect each others work and talents. I choose the safer road of staying with HP while Kip had the drive and desires to take on more risk and challenges. Over the years we have reconnected at times to share ideas and discuss technology trends. My overall assessment of Kip's talents are his drive to deliver a wonderful product through technology, the best design, and effective management that is able to pull it all together. Kip is truly an effective leader, gains respect from all who work with him, and especially gains respect from his technology team because he understands them, knows their challenges and knows the technology.”",
            "Buford Conley “I have worked with Kip on two occasions. First, he led the operations and engineering efforts at Sitelet, a software company in my portfolio. He did a fantastic job of hitting all milestones and exceeding expectations. In fact, his work was so impressive that when he came to me with the idea of joining Advisor Team, I decided to invest in him again, this time with Kip in the CEO role. Kip is extremely bright, strategic, objective, and self-aware. He has displayed the highest degrees of professional integrity in difficult situations, and consistently puts the interests of shareholders above his own.”"

            "Ira Kleiner “It is my pleasure to write a reference for Sachin Menon who was an exceptional boss and an inspirational leader for me. I worked under Sachin as an employee at Oracle, and under the direct supervision of Sachin. I can personally attest to Sachin’s gifts as both a manager and a subject matter expert of Oracle Cloud and Applications. Sachin always provided me with the guidance I needed to make sure I succeeded in my role. I was given the freedom and flexibility to look for creative solutions for our customers and work on projects that were interesting to me. It is this attention to detail and innovative encouragement that has led to growth for me in my career as both an individual and contributor. I am grateful to Sachin for his understanding of mentorship and leadership. He may not know it, but he was truly an inspiration to me on how to strive for success. My colleagues and I have always been grateful for his leadership, and for the care and attention that goes into managing our everyday affairs. All above, in my long career, Sachin was my favorite manager to work under and I would definitely work with him again in the future if given the opportunity. Ira D. Kleiner ”",
            "Dipak Panda “One thing that will stay with me about the association with Sachin is the beaming smile. He is a person who is very methodical with his work and a very balanced head on his shoulders; a wonderful colleague to work with. If you are to define the qualities a pre-sales person needs to have, well then I guess you would look at Sachin and write them down. A hardcore pre-sales person who has the ability to not only open doors but also to ensure that he can get into the skin of customers. Sachin is an absolute package – a leader, a mentor, a colleague, a friend. I must say that the leadership and people skill that he demonstrated, during that time of chaos, are really commendable. Sachin is an epitome of hard work, sincerity, calmness in stormy conditions, and never-give-up attitude. Personally, he adores a very charming & approachable personality and an equally ground to earth attitude. It has been my pleasure and privilege to have worked with him. I wish him good luck and recommend him for any job that needs the mental toughness, strong leadership, great people and technical skills.”"

What I also really admire about Brendon is his ability to stay cool and composed despite being at the mercy of many demands of his cross functional teams - not an easy feat considering there's only 1 Brendon but many teams at McCann group who would steal him for this and that. Add to his brilliant brains is his affable personality which makes working with him a joy for his colleagues and clients. At time I wish I could clone him! ”",
            "Kurt Wolff “I worked with Brendon when he was involved in launching CNET Australia's Music Centre. He was a complete pleasure to work with--friendly, resourceful, quick to respond, and fully informed regarding his product, for which he clearly had genuine passion.”"

            "“From the day Mike Montecillo joined the State of Michigan's Office of Enterprise Security as a student, it was clear than he was someone special. Mike worked long and hard to ensure that security projects were done in a thorough and professional manner. Over time his drive and energy led to his role as a security expert for the state and as a consultant. Mike was excellent at researching products and making great product choices, but his skills didn't stop there. He brought in several cutting- edge security products, piloted them, and Mike eventually led the integration of Qualys and other tools, which became part of our infrastructure. These projects led to our PCI-compliance as a state and helped secure mission-critical apps and systems. I don't hesitate in recommending Mike. He is a winner who goes the extra mile to achieve success.” Show less"

He streamlined the operational process for a more predictable & scalable sales-cycle “blueprint” that his organization still embraces. Mike is a fantastic leader & motivator to his organization. I believe he earns the trust of his people by treating all team members with equal respect and honesty – regardless of rank or title.”",
            "LinkedIn User “I was personally recruited by Mike to join Oracle's SMB Division, focusing on providing our Customer Experience solutions to growing organizations within the Virginia territory. From Day 1, Mike has been the ideal manager to work with. He is extremely hands on and interactive with not just his direct reports, but others within our sales group in providing outstanding advice and best practices in cold calling, objection overcoming, and knowing when to ask for the business. Having a second voice like Mike's on discovery and demonstration calls, coupled with his masterful teaching and reinforcement of the Sandler methodology, enabled me to learn more about my prospects/clients, what their true needs were, and when they were looking to have a solution put in place. Our division is fortunate enough to have a leader like Mike on the team and it has been a great experience learning from him in order to grow as a consultative sales professional and eventually, a manager in my own right.”"

            "M C Seakher Kasibhatla “I have had the opportunity to work under Keshav for the past year, looking back at my journey I could clearly see how I am shaped into a true Product owner. Keshav is very good at honing the skill set of his team members and at times he tests their tenacity not to stress them out but to bring the best out of them. He provides zones of ownership to his team members on the products they are working on to bring the best out of them at the same time having an overall control on the vision - a true Program Manager. His solution box never runs out of ideas, he is very good at drawing a line to mitigate an immediate solution vs deferring it. He stands out in customer negotiation skill set from the pool of people I have seen in my tenure. Although being a Director of Product management he never hesitates to take up one of the smallest tasks when in need for a project, a true leader by example. He is highly creative in his thoughts about the product/project and is a big picture thinker, I have seen this on several occasions when we had long discussions about our products. Being under his umbrella helped me a great deal in taking my product / project management skills to a whole new level. I would put Keshav in the top 1% of the Product Directors I know of and would highly recommend him to any organization.”",
            "LinkedIn User “Keshav’s deep knowledge of business issues, a penchant for the latest IT technologies, his attention to detail without losing focus on the 'big picture' and a ‘Can Do’ approach are some of the traits which are invaluable in converting complex business ideas into ‘real life software solutions’ that work. He is a smart, diligent team player with excellent leadership qualities who knows how to bring the best out in people. As a product/project manager, I am sure Keshav has the right mix of qualities and the attitude to come out a winner in every situation his work demands. It was a pleasure working with him.”"

He leads by example and is exceptionally technical (Hardware Development, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Cloud Computing - the list just goes on!) owing to endless hours of research and readings. What makes Jason a unique technical leader is his warm personality and the fact that he is extremely approachable - we met over coffee in the hallway and a few days/meetings later, working for his project became the reason why I loved my job! Jason is one of those mentors who is always looking to innovate and and suggest ways to improvise current technology. He goes beyond his way to look out for his team and helps engineers find projects that truly fit their interests. I wouldn't blink twice if I had an opportunity to work for/with him again in my career. He is that amazing mentor who quickly becomes a friend! ”",
            "Asmita Nijsure “I worked with Jason when I moved to the Machine Learning initiative led by him within Oracle. Jason had a well-organized and meticulous style of leading the project which I immediately found inspirational. He was very good at identifying the problems and making quick decisions. He took into account the strengths of each team member and worked closely with us to find our next projects. He is very sociable and is great at connecting people who could help each other. His technical expertise in full system architecture and deep understanding of current trends in Cloud computing and Machine Learning was a great advantage for our team. I learnt a lot during my time working with Jason and I would highly recommend him. ”"

I am also an experienced HCI and Design educator who previously worked as the Associate Director for the MHCI+D program at the University of Washington and an Associate Teaching Professor for the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. Most recently, I was a Design Director at Artefact and Principal UX at 98point6, in Seattle, WA. I have contributed my design expertise to a wide range of projects from improving the experience for an therapist and coaches practicing telehealth, defining the future of project and head mounted MXR experiences to envisioning and designing the UI/UX for medical robotics technology. I have also worked with the award-winning exhibition design firm, Studio Matthews. I helped design the wayfinding experience for Google’s Redmond Campus and the University of Washington. I also helped explore the local and conventioneer experience for the Washington State Convention Center expansion. In 2015, I completed my graduate studies at the University of Washington, where I earned my Master of Design degree with a focus on Interaction Design. During my time there, I spent a year looking at the relationship between young adults and international news. I was part of the interaction design team at Teague’s Seattle Innovation Studio, collaborating, leading and inspiring teams of designers / makers to create thoughtful & tangible user experiences to help build the technology of the future for both mobile devices in emerging markets as well as envisioning transportation of the future. From 2004 to 2013 I served as Principal and Design Director at LitFuse Design, an interactive design consultancy that I co-founded. I oversaw and collaborated with professionals specializing in a variety of media to create interactive campaigns that have reached a global audience. Through this experience I attained recognition within the industry as a passionate, forward thinking interactive designer. Under my leadership, LitFuse Design became an award winning interactive design firm recognized for creating highly original and entertaining interactive content for high profile clients, with work featured in multiple Super Bowl campaigns.",

            "Dave McColgin “I worked with Scott as he designed a tool for therapists to meet with patients digitally, make decisions, and document progress. His success depended on quickly learning a complex domain and building trust with clinical, product, and technical partners. Open-ended questions, frameworks for guiding discussion, and early sharing of ideas for feedback with clearly articulated rationale were all part of his success. He earned multiple unsolicited and glowing testimonials beginning with his job interviewers and continuing throughout his tenure. He impressed our executive, who said he set the bar for principal level UX contributions after seeing his clear and comprehensive communication. Scott oriented multiple large development teams as they came on to the project, spotted a big technical dependency and made connections proactively to prevent it from blocking progress, and even served - with distinction - as de facto PM while there was a gap. Scott is also a famously thoughtful and helpful mentor who helped our team connect and grow during remote work. He was a key part of our dream team and I only wish we could have served him more opportunities for challenging work worthy of his skill.”",
            "Gavin Kelly “Scott is a rare breed of designer, highly skilled at his craft and willing to jump in and immerse himself in the details, and at the same time he brings a strategic mindset, able to frame design for its maximum business and positive societal impact. Scott is experienced in user research, well versed in technology, and is pragmatic in his development of solutions. Above all, Scott is an empathetic leader and a vocal and passionate advocate for members of his team. I would highly recommend Scott to anyone looking for a person to elevate the calibre of design in their organization.”"

As someone who was junior level launching their early career and passion to Machine Learning, Dr Peterson was able to provide to me a very indepth perception of the life of a Data Scientist. I reached out to him as i was preparing for an interview, and the knowledge he was able to provide to me was priceless. He also was able to help me through the current python program i am developing and helping me figure out the algorithms to best execute it. Thank you so much Dr Peterson for sharing your knowledge!”"

I could heap on the compliments, but what I find most impressive about Colin is his innate ability to stay grounded and REALLY understand what motivates his team. Awareness is an often over-looked trait, but done right- brilliant. The culture he's created is progressive, aims for constant learning; and by default, minimizes turnover. Leadership done right. Cheers, Colin!”",

It was my pleasure to work with Colin and I hope we can collaborate again in the future. Invaluable. ”"

          "about": "I am a highly motivated individual, a passionate numismatist, and an established software engineer. My penchant for computers led me to pursue it professionally. Currently, I am a Technical Leader in the Containers and Kubernetes organization at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. My team has built highly scalable distributed services which operate in 50+ regions across the globe. I joined Oracle as a Member of Technical Staff (IC1) and grown into a Consulting Member of Technical Staff (IC5). I have been part of multiple cloud services that were built from scratch and have had a direct impact on the business. I graduated with First-class honours in Computing from Imperial College London in June 2018. In the past, I have interned at two well-established companies in the United Kingdom, worked for a hot and fast-rising startup in London, organized hackathons, conferences and lectured on Web Development. Over the years, I have worked with various types of technologies including Kubernetes, Go, Java, JavaScript, messaging and stream libraries such as Kafka and Samza. My work with the startup has given me the quintessential experience of working in a fast-paced and agile environment whereas working for companies like Oracle, Skyscanner and Schlumberger has installed the ability to work in a highly professional setting in me. I believe that the skills I have acquired through these activities helped me become a strong software engineer. During my years at Imperial, I studied interesting courses such as Distributed Algorithms, Machine Learning, Models of Computation, Compilers, and Software Engineering Design. These intriguing courses have completely changed my outlook of Computing and helped me understand various concepts and practices which were completely oblivious to me. I also ran a 10-week course on Web Development from January 2017 to March 2017 in the Department of Computing. The workshop was a success and was received very well by the students in the department. That speaks of my interest in Computing and the activities related to it. On the side, I like to collect coins and notes, click pictuers, watch TV series and cook delicious food.",

            "Keith Thomas “Terms like “node clusters,” “Oracle RAC stress and destructive testing,” and “an ability to effectively support mixed OLTP/DSS environments” might roll off the tongues of DBA’s with relative ease, but to the outside word they might as well have been lifted directly from the Rosetta Stone. Yet, if understood properly the concept conveyed by these words can literally mean millions of dollars in savings and/or added value for the average Fortune 500 company. The key then is not simply to find someone who understands those concepts, but someone who can also communicate them effectively to the non-technical decision maker. In 2 years of working with Dan Norris, I was repeatedly amazed at his ability to take highly advanced Oracle Database technology-related topics and weave them into white papers, brochures and web content that was accessible to a much wider non-technical audience. Beyond being a good writer, Dan was never too busy to take time out to act as a sort of mentor, explaining what a particularly piece of technology did and why it was important. That made him an invaluable colleague and team member.”",
            "LinkedIn User “I worked under Dan at Piocon. I always respected his honesty and up front attitude. He is very out going and intelligent. He was a good boss and always helpful. I would work for him again.”"

I have always found him to be tremendously thorough not just in the technical solutions, but in his approach to the customer. While in Architect roles, he demonstrated tremendous business acumen and it was this acumen that allowed him to build rapport not only with the technical teams, but the business owners. More recently, Ashok held a leadership position within the North American Customer Success organization, he took a very intentional approach to running his business. He was able to separate the noise of a large organization and focus on the strategic goals. Through this focus, Ashok was able to align the Customer Success team appropriately to drive the needed Cloud consumption and growth. ”"

            "“I have had the pleasure of working with Ross Miller for well over ten years. Ross is an outstanding leader. He is straight forward, honest, decisive, and genuine. I have always enjoyed working for Ross as he has the rare ability to consistently bring out the best in his employees, and provides the critical feedback necessary to improve and grow as an individual. Ross often leads by example, often participating with the team in challenging sales cycles to set the tone for a successful campaign. Ross is masterful as when to assist, and when to step back and let the team or individual run with a new or important challenge. Ross also excels at navigating complex, challenging sales cycles. He collaborates well with his sales counterparts and often thinks outside the box to solve challenging issues that can derail a sales cycle. I have personally seen Ross maneuver through what seemed like insurmountable odds and come out on top. To conclude, Ross comes highly recommended for his outstanding leadership, his great savvy within complex sales cycles, and for being just an all around genuinely good person.” Show less",
            "“I had worked directly for Ross at Cognos/IBM for a number of years prior to him taking on an expanded sales leadership role. Ross was my manager when I first took on a pre-sales position and provided me with the mentorship, training, and direction to become a top contributor within the organization. When given the opportunity to once again work directly for Ross, I made the decision to leave IBM and follow under his strong leadership at another organization (iMANY). Ross has been a leader within iMANY responsible for building out a high performance technical sales team, driving sales methodology, and always working towards the best interests of his team and our clients. I value the relationship Ross and I have built and all that I have learned from him over the years. I am confident that he will continue to drive success at iMANY or with any organization in need of top performing technical sales leadership.” Show less"

His admirable work ethic was apparent from day one. He wasn't out worked. Careful and thoughtful analysis goes into his decision-making; he takes his time to get it right and seems to always get it right. You'll find yourself rooting for him. The guy you want on your team. 20+ years and counting...he is still a good friend.”",

Noah made an instant and lasting impact on both the financial success and the culture of our business - selling Demand Solutions forecasting and supply chain management software. Noah is without a doubt the most creative sales person I’ve worked with. He consistently crushed his annual goals, and helped energize the rest of our team with his contagious enthusiasm. He is not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, but he is also quick to embrace consensus decisions. Noah is an exceptionally good listener, and one of the most thoughtful individuals in my life.”"

His ability to explain a technical details in simple and understandable words are amazing. He likes to share his knowledge and teach how to troubleshoot the issue from the top to the bottom. Frankly speaking, Abel is a \"Master\" ( with capital M ) and I have a lot of respect for him.”",

            "Travis Pierce “I've had the privilege of working with Jill for years, and in that time, I’ve watched her lead the Oracle Health Operations team through intense turbulence and transformation. She didn’t just navigate change, rather she drove it with clarity, precision, and an unwavering commitment to making things better. What sets Jill apart is her rare ability to balance big-picture strategy with deep operational expertise. She creates an environment where teams feel both challenged and supported, pushing for innovation while ensuring execution stays sharp. People don’t just work for Jill, they rally behind her because they trust her vision and leadership. One of the best examples of her impact was leading the operational integration of one of the largest healthcare tech acquisitions ever. She aligned stakeholders, made tough, but necessary calls, and kept morale high through the chaos, ultimately delivering an on-time, successful integration of our sales processes and operations, which is a feat that many would have fumbled. Jill is a force multiplier, a top-tier leader, and someone I feel incredibly lucky to work with and learn from. Her leadership isn’t just effective, it’s transformative. I have no doubt she’ll continue to drive meaningful impact for our organization, or any that's lucky enough work with her!”",
            "Damian Ponzio, MBA “As someone who has been in financial operations for 10+ years, and sales operations for an additional 10+, Jill Whitmore is the most talented Operations Executive I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Most executives exhibit a high level of skill in some basic areas, whereas Jill, is at the top across the spectrum. The following is a combination of track record, skills, and style, I have the privilege of sharing. Results & Outcomes It starts with Outcomes, and a 'say-do' ratio that is top notch. I was personally part of a team she led that completely transformed Sales Operations yielding better sales & revenue growth through reengineered Processes that capitalized on Grade A tooling. Her ability to mold, & build a passionate, loyal team was the glue that brought everything together. Planning & Coordination It is my understanding that the aforementioned wasn't the first operational 'rescue' she was a part of, as she seems to have mastered a formula for success. One of those components is her ability to plan. One good example is the utilization of basic but highly effective standard methods like a 30-60-90 day plans. The key is matching skill sets and roles to tasks within the plan, and ensuring a balance with not only the right level of oversight, but also the degree of autonomy for iterations throughout execution. Preparation Jill is meticulous when it comes to being prepared for anything ranging from informal conversations, to workshops, to executive level briefings, proposals, & presentations. No detail is to small whether it be dress-code, punctuality, physical venue details, or even the basics with flawless spelling & punctuation throughout all materials. All of these 'little things' add up in not only lending to the successful outcomes of everyday encounters, but also lend to a reputation that fosters a sense of reliability and an operational 'gold standard'. People Jill is THE Master at managing people not only to achieve and exceed goals, but also to dfensure each person feels a sense of belonging the provisioning of opportunities to be heard & contribute. She will guide, challenge, and in open forums ask for opinions with the intent of either utilizing the feedback or capitalizing on a teaching moment in a way that creates clarity and promotes gratitude from participants. She holds career development as a top priority knowing investment in people yields immeasurable value to the current and future business. I've know several SVPs that have touted Jill as the best people manager they have ever worked with. Overall in my opinion, her two greatest asset are her integrity, and her genuine concern and care for people. Both are of the upmost importance to the success of any business and more importantly to a successful and fulfilling life. I can say with confidence that I, and countless others would jump at the opportunity to be part of an organization led by Jill, knowing the path leads to success and fulfillment.”"

            "Keith Thomas “Terms like “node clusters,” “Oracle RAC stress and destructive testing,” and “an ability to effectively support mixed OLTP/DSS environments” might roll off the tongues of DBA’s with relative ease, but to the outside word they might as well have been lifted directly from the Rosetta Stone. Yet, if understood properly the concept conveyed by these words can literally mean millions of dollars in savings and/or added value for the average Fortune 500 company. The key then is not simply to find someone who understands those concepts, but someone who can also communicate them effectively to the non-technical decision maker. In 2 years of working with Dan Norris, I was repeatedly amazed at his ability to take highly advanced Oracle Database technology-related topics and weave them into white papers, brochures and web content that was accessible to a much wider non-technical audience. Beyond being a good writer, Dan was never too busy to take time out to act as a sort of mentor, explaining what a particularly piece of technology did and why it was important. That made him an invaluable colleague and team member.”",
            "LinkedIn User “I worked under Dan at Piocon. I always respected his honesty and up front attitude. He is very out going and intelligent. He was a good boss and always helpful. I would work for him again.”"

The solution that my team developed would eventually create the foundation architecture for many components of Oracle's application suite - including the Trading Community Architecture and Utility Customer Care and Billing."

            "AJ Alkasmi “Ross has an emotional intelligence at play that makes everyone around him feel truly heard, valued, and respected. It's no surprise that teams under his guidance are not only more vocal but are also more proactive and engaged. He fosters a culture where people don't just work – they believe, they contribute, and they grow. In a world full of noise, his clarity of thought and dedication to understanding both the message and the messenger is a breath of fresh air. It's been a privilege to work alongside him, to witness this unique ability firsthand, and to have our startup benefit from it.”",
            "Rasmus Ekman “I have had the pleasure of working with Ross, acting as Moneytree's point of contact at AWS. Having had the experience of working with several hundreds of clients at AWS, ranging from start ups up to financial institutions, it is with great confidence I say that Ross is the top of the crop in terms of both technical know-how, devops chops and security best practices. I have seen better technical solutions and high security mind set come out of Ross than most large scale financial institutions. In other words, if you need a tech rock star, he would be on the top of my list.”"

I have always found him to be tremendously thorough not just in the technical solutions, but in his approach to the customer. While in Architect roles, he demonstrated tremendous business acumen and it was this acumen that allowed him to build rapport not only with the technical teams, but the business owners. More recently, Ashok held a leadership position within the North American Customer Success organization, he took a very intentional approach to running his business. He was able to separate the noise of a large organization and focus on the strategic goals. Through this focus, Ashok was able to align the Customer Success team appropriately to drive the needed Cloud consumption and growth. ”"

I recommend Gaurava to any role that would benefit from these qualities in a software engineer.”",
            "Raghu Reddy “Almost three years of my professional life were spent collaborating with Gaurava on building the best Omni channel bot builder products- Conversation Builder, at 247. ai. He is knowledgeable about technology and attentive to detail. I have collaborated with many brilliant engineers during my time at the company, but he stands out among the rest. When confronted with a challenging issue, he invariably proposes a straightforward technical solution, which, in most cases, is the most viable option. He has a lot of compassion and understanding for the clients, and he always makes sure to do enough research to fully comprehend the issue before offering any solutions. In addition to his incredible UI and backend coding expertise, Gaurava also contributes his product thinking, which is always an asset to the team and enables product managers to get their work done more quickly.”"

            "“I have had the pleasure of working with Ross Miller for well over ten years. Ross is an outstanding leader. He is straight forward, honest, decisive, and genuine. I have always enjoyed working for Ross as he has the rare ability to consistently bring out the best in his employees, and provides the critical feedback necessary to improve and grow as an individual. Ross often leads by example, often participating with the team in challenging sales cycles to set the tone for a successful campaign. Ross is masterful as when to assist, and when to step back and let the team or individual run with a new or important challenge. Ross also excels at navigating complex, challenging sales cycles. He collaborates well with his sales counterparts and often thinks outside the box to solve challenging issues that can derail a sales cycle. I have personally seen Ross maneuver through what seemed like insurmountable odds and come out on top. To conclude, Ross comes highly recommended for his outstanding leadership, his great savvy within complex sales cycles, and for being just an all around genuinely good person.” Show less",
            "“I had worked directly for Ross at Cognos/IBM for a number of years prior to him taking on an expanded sales leadership role. Ross was my manager when I first took on a pre-sales position and provided me with the mentorship, training, and direction to become a top contributor within the organization. When given the opportunity to once again work directly for Ross, I made the decision to leave IBM and follow under his strong leadership at another organization (iMANY). Ross has been a leader within iMANY responsible for building out a high performance technical sales team, driving sales methodology, and always working towards the best interests of his team and our clients. I value the relationship Ross and I have built and all that I have learned from him over the years. I am confident that he will continue to drive success at iMANY or with any organization in need of top performing technical sales leadership.” Show less"

His sense of humour, straight-forward approach, genuine concern for the career progression of every individual is heart warming. His multitasking is truly humbling: researcher, research manager, people manager, security lead, and apart from that he finds time to volunteer for community causes. Age has failed to bend him, accepted its defeat and has offered him the true wisdom. His managerial style is informal and hands-off. But the way he takes on multiple tasks, makes himself available for casual chats to highly formal meetings, prioritises works for the individual, selflessly involves himself in the team work, and takes initiatives for exploring new works, cannot help but infect others.”",

            "Carmen Zannier “Ben's strength is that he can make an authentic connection with anyone. I worked closely with Ben over a 2.5 year period of significant people growth in my dev group in Kitchener-Waterloo. During this time I saw Ben repeatedly make very real connections with candidates and champion their strengths as they pertained to our business. He truly cares about who people are, and is energized by determining how their strengths help a business grow and develop. At one particular recruiting event I sat side by side with Ben while we spoke with a long line-up of candidates and was incredibly impressed with what I saw: Ben listened very carefully to each and every individual, he found something in every conversation he could connect with and before the conversation ended, Ben proposed something of value for the individual, whether it benefited the individual in their search, or benefited the individual as it pertained to our hiring needs. Ben's understanding of business drivers is consistently strong as is his ability to lay down effective recruiting process, but what makes him a stand-out recruiter is how genuinely he cares about who people are and how well he can connect with them. No matter the business or the industry, this strength of Ben's no doubt fuels his success as a recruiter and by extension success for the company he is working hard to help grow. ”",
            "Brock Musgrave “I had the opportunity to work as Ben’s colleague for over seven years at Oracle. During this period I observed and collaborated with him on countless searches, strategy calls, continuous improvement projects, and team calls. Ben is highly intelligent, collaborative, and has an infectious sense of humor. He is viewed as a “subject-matter expert” by executive leadership, hiring managers, and peers. Ben was our team’s “recruiting technology expert”, which is high praise, coming from a team of technology-focused recruiters. Ben motivates and leads by example. He has a true “business-partner” mentality with strong influencing qualities and executive credibility. He takes a consultative approach and he is not afraid to tactfully, “push back”, to correct a course of action. I highly recommend Ben and I would welcome the chance to partner with him anytime in the future. Best, Brock Musgrave ”"

What sets him apart is his network of relationships in the bureaucracy, ability to articulate the value of ICT transformation to them in clear terms and demonstrated ability to create large transformational opportunities in this sector. His acceptance, thought leadership and credibility has been built over years of nurturing relationships, delivering value and unflinching commitment to timelines. He has been a performer across the roles he has played but the single-most attribute is his positive outlook, desire to win and adaptibility to change. He is an asset.”",

We were able to successfully implement that transformation and bring about efficiency in the order workflow leading to significant reduction in time to provision. Gaurav was extremely thorough in identifying the flows that required reengineering and also brought in a wealth of knowledge that helped all the partnering stakeholders successfully implement this project with essentially no loss of service and resulting in faster revenue recognition for Oracle.

He was able to teach and share knowledge while still giving the learners the room they needed to grow and discover in their own way. Barry was able to dive in to massively complex problems and build technical solutions that work. Anyone would be lucky to have him on their team.”",

Barry has a hands-on work approach both in terms of the product and customer engagement/empathy. As a result Barry has been instrumental in landing many key deployments of search enabling digital transformation for large organizations. Barry has at the same time listened carefully to customer feedback and requests and brought these insights back to R&D. Barrys hands-on feedback has directly impacted many of the product improvements in SharePoint search and Delve.”"

His high ethical standard and professional demeanor compliment his role as executive sponsor, mentor, and sales leader. A role that he has used to transform several sales organizations to a value based sales model and dramatic revenue growth.”",
            "Dave Edstrom “I had the great honor and privilege to work for Dave Profozich for four years at Sun Microsystems. Dave always showed tremendous courage, vision, leadership and an unshakable moral compass. During this period, from 2005 to 2009, was the most tumultuous I have seen at Sun Microsystems. I mention this fact, regarding this intense time of change at Sun Microsystems, because it is during the tough times you find out who your *real* leaders are. Dave was dealt more challenges in these four years than I have seen in my 30+ years in the computer industry and yet, Dave was always the ultimate professional. Dave was a 24/7 Leader. It did not matter whether it was late at night or on a weekend, Dave Profozich was always there to lead his troops. No Sun employee put in longer or harder hours than Dave Profozich. A question that most employees are asked about a former boss is, \"would you work for him/her again?\" My response to that question for Dave Profozich is, \"in a femtosecond.\"”"

The project was also based on the idea that browser based applications did not provide the interaction or the simplicity that users demanded. Users needed mini-applications that gave them the information that they precisely needed and allowed them to launch into more detail with broader browser based applications. This was created during a short era when desktop gadgets were all the rage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Widgets and therefore the concepts overlapped. This project quickly became a product but slowly faded into maintenance with the demise of desktop gadgets and the rise of app store applications.http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/smart-space/overview/smart-space-1-124550.jpghttp://www.information-management.com/news/1070656-1.htmlhttp://www.itp.net/5067-hyperions-smart-move-in-bi-space/?tab=article#.Ujh8rRaRi-I"

For the project we created an XML exchange over HTTP with similar rules as REST before REST gained acceptance. The prototype was demoed at the Hyperion Solutions conference in Chicago (04/2004) with much fan-fair. The prototype quickly moved in to product mode and was delivered as a product in 2005 and is still a critical product in both EPM and BI."

One of the things I admire most about Roger is the passionate authenticity he brings to his business interactions. He takes a genuine interest in helping his customers succeed, and this translates seamlessly to a trust that is built with his clients from the start. He has a keen ability to connect with people by speaking the language of the business and IT professionals he supports. Furthermore, his business acumen and ability to navigate complex deals has made him a great partner. I have no doubt that Roger will be a value add to any organization lucky enough to have him on their team.”",

At the end of my contract with Savi, I recommended Roger to lead the Market Management team for his product knowledge, market insight and leadership. Roger is extremely hard working and has great insight in understanding customer value. I would recommend Roger for marketing leadership positions in the high tech industry.”"

            "Uma Sabada “Anders is one of the smartest engineer I have worked with. Anders is a versatile, stand-out engineer with rock solid work ethics, clean design ideas, and a keen attention to detail. He is a quick learner and a great team player - willing to work on any area as demanded by the project. The team members value his technical ability and input and often ask him to review their code checkins or design docs. His technical expertise, communication skills, and drive makes him a valuable team member. Anders is also very involved in mentoring and grooming interns and new college graduates. He proactively recommends projects and meets with new employees both one-on-one and in groups to facilitate their quick ramp up. Anders is knowledgeable, approachable, and a great role model - a cornerstone member for any team looking to hire top talent and grow. I highly recommend Anders Swanson.”",
            "Brad Root “Anders is an intelligent & exceptionally talented cloud software engineer and technical leader with a high aptitude for picking up new technologies, tools, and processes quickly. He reported to me and was responsible for the development, deployment, and support of infrastructure and several Java-based microservices in the enterprise security management platform group's threat event processing stack. As an intern on my team, Anders exceeded expectations as he rapidly learned to develop and deploy microservices and became a go-to expert for containers and Kubernetes. His impact and performance led to a full-time position on my team and over the following two years, Anders's growth, fueled by his initiative and ambition, continued to accelerate: He added new microservices, made process improvements to the CI/CD pipeline, introduced new technologies to improve supportability and developer adoption of the stack, significantly reduced costs of operating services in AWS, and much more. Anders also demonstrated technical leadership; he provided design and integration guidance to external teams and successfully mentored two interns whom each made meaningful contributions to our production stack and later provided overwhelmingly positive feedback regarding their experience working with Anders. Anders is highly regarded by this peers, architects, principal engineers, and other engineering leaders in his group. He is a pleasure to work and can be trusted to complete his tasks, with high quality, and communicate regularly with his team. He's an extraordinary engineer, an up-and-coming technical leader, and would be a welcomed asset to any high-performing team. I'm looking forward to following Anders as he continues progress in his career.”"

            "Logan Frost “I had the opportunity to work with Liza at Gartner on numerous campus recruiting trips throughout the Midwest. During our time as colleagues our recruiting trips were constantly defined by Liza’s professionalism, grace and wit. It can be overwhelming managing just the expectations of one professor, student or campus, let alone dozens throughout a territory. Nevertheless each time I coordinated with Liza we were met with excitement at each college campus we visited. This is a testament to the relationships she builds and the value she brings in every interaction. This excitement was seen at every level, across students, clubs, professors and schools. Her energy and goodwill to others is palpable and magnetic. The last defining characteristic I want to highlight is Liza’s compassion and empathy. When dealing with college graduates and young professionals there is often times quite a bit riding on a job offer. Regardless of her ability to offer a certain candidate a job Liza always ensured the students she worked with felt empowered, confident and proud of their backgrounds and experiences. She constantly works to find and align opportunities within her network to further support those around her. She is a pleasure to be around personally and professionally and will make incredibly contributions to whatever team is fortunate to have her. ”"

            "Namendra Kumar “Prasad and I have worked together for a long time on the various iterations of Microsoft's Real Time Communication products (Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business, Lync, Office Communications Server). In everything we have partnered on, I have found Prasad to be thorough, diligent, dependable and most-importantly level-headed & calm. I have seen Prasad take on struggling teams and improving their performance, I have seen Prasad handle burning issues with a unique mixture of speed & aplomb. Under his leadership, the Voice Applications area powering a big portion of Teams Voice scale to astronomical numbers, and Teams Telephony extended to many new markets & scenarios. While doing all this, Prasad always finds time to create personal bond, and show genuine care for his reports as well as his peers. I still remember when my then manager introduced me to Prasad many many years back. He had said, \"Meet Prasad, he is a great guy who will always help you\", and over more than a decade, he has done just that, and I am grateful to have such a colleague & friend.”",
            "Rob Young “Prasad is an inciteful, empathetic, and highly effective engineering leader who understands what it takes to bring people together to deliver on large ambitious projects. I had to opportunity to work with Prasad over a 3 year period as our respective teams built out the services powering enterprise PSTN capabilities that power Microsoft Teams and Azure Communications Services today. While I admired Prasad’s engineering skills and domain expertise in routing and networking, it was his ability to empathize and build a culture of trust that impressed me the most. Prasad’s contributions were fundamental in attracting, retaining, and growing the capability of our talent as we scaled up. Prasad’s leadership spanned core dev, QA and operations teams and he was ever present to support his teams during key services incidents or other challenging situations. Prasad is highly capable and genuinely cares about the people and outcomes he is accountable for - I’d recommend him for any engineering leadership role without hesitation.”"

Rich Evans and I worked together at Oracle on the Enterprise Security Team where Rich was a valued member our Team working with Oracle’s largest accounts. Rich displays not only a deep knowledge of Security and technology in general but has those rare talents of being a fantastic presenter and ability to flow with client questions and changes in direction during a presentation. Bottom-line, I am a better salesperson in working with Rich and he is an asset to any organization whether the company he works for, the accounts he serves and the Team he makes stronger.”",

During later years Mikael continued to show extraordinary innovation, initiative, leadership, and strategic market vision for Virtualization in the JVM/Hypervisor investments of BEA Systems. Over the years, I have experienced and seen continued and broadened team leadership skills and deepend market insight and vision capacity. Mikael comes with my best recommendations as I can always trust objectivity, quality, delivery, and unique innovation that brings new market opportunities of great value, whenever I have Mikael working in or with my team.”",

As a leader, Jason stands out because he cares so much. About the people on his teams. About cutting through politics and short-term thinking. And about the impact he and the people he empowers have. Jason’s hitting his stride leading big, difficult, cross-functional projects now and I’m excited to see him continue to have a larger and larger impact in the world.”",
            "rui jiang “I worked closely with Jason on a project to rewrite a very complex legacy business application. Jason always has long term vision for the product and the technology to build the product. He has the ability to present his vision in a visual way that’s easy for others to understand. He is open minded, willing to listen to others even when he strongly believes in his own idea. Jason is very self-disciplined and executes his vision almost flawlessly. Jason is an excellent manager. He trusts the people working for him while making sure the big picture is still on track. Jason uses his many talents to selflessly help others, including mentoring people in their career development. He is one of the best, as a manager and a person, I’ve ever worked with. ”"

I worked with Mackenzie long enough to know that she is the ultimate team player, and a gift to any squad: consistent, professional, thorough, thoughtful, takes tremendous pride in execution and team success. Even when Mackenzie's and my reporting lines changed due to a company restructuring, she was still someone I continued to reach out to and partner with cross-functionally because her expertise shines well beyond her areas of focus. An asset to any team, a rare talent, and a friend on my short list of people to call when life throws a curve ball.”",

Mackenzie has helped lead our philanthropy team at Equinix for years, and developed programs that continue to engage, encourage and elevate employees. I worked closely with Mackenzie in our global programs, where she challenged the team to think beyond their surroundings and create relatable and accessible content for our employees. Mackenzie shines in teaching and developing the team she leads and leads in service to everyone on the team. Any company would be honored to have you, and I am honored to have worked with you.”"
