As IBM's engagement manger for Mead's global SAP implementation, his honesty, experience, and counsel enabled us to build a world class program that balanced internal and external resources, deliver on agressive implementation plans, and do the knowledge transfer necessary to let Mead, and subsequently MeadWestvaco, own the result to drive process improvements that yielded real value at the investment we had agreed on, on the schedule we needed. I could alwys count on Chris to tell me what I needed to know, not what I wanted to hear. His integrity is impeccable. I not only respect Chris as a professional, I have come to think of him as a close business associate and a friend.”",

          "about": "I am Partner in the Advisory Services at PwC’s Montréal office. I lead the Forensic & Disputes Services practice for the Québec region and lead the Crisis Management Services for PwC Canada. Known and recognized as an authority in the business community, my work consists of advising companies in preparing, responding and emerging stronger from crisis. In response times, I assist companies in the first hour, leading forensic investigations and, in the end, assist companies in asset recovery strategy, in addressing reputation risks and preventing the risk of recurrences. I have more than 25 years of experience in forensic accounting, damage quantification, audit and evaluation of business process and internal controls in the fight against fraud (anti-corruption and anti-money laundering) as well as compliance matters (AML, CFPOA). In addition to my professional experience, I give lectures, write publications and am involved in training the next generation of leaders notably at PwC and in the past at HEC Montréal and Concordia University. Keeping a balance between work, family life, personal activities and giving back to the community is very important to me. I also help women achieve their full professional potential as an active member of the ProfessionnELLES initiative at PwC’s Montréal office and on a PwC National front. This initiative’s goal is to promote the talent of our female employees. I received PWC Team Performance (2017-2018) & PwC CEO Award-Team Winner 2012, awards given to teams achieving outstanding results in client servicing & are role models for the PwC experience behaviors. I was a finalist for AFFQ’s 2013 “Étoile montante” Award, an award by the Association des Femmes en Finance du Québec (AFFQ) recognizing a member for her career development & outstanding professional qualities in the field of finance and business, and for her leadership and amazing determination.

Karthikeyan was in charge -among other things - of the test automation of various complex processes, and in particular of processes related to the creation and management of audit engagements in a multinational group audit scenario. Kathikeyan was very successful. He was able to proactively interact with business representatives to understand requirements to propose the best possible solutions and in the end to deliver working automation routines. I am very satisfied with his work, the results he delivered and also with his approach and positive attitude. I hope this recommendation can be useful as a reference for other professionals/projects that need test automation expertise. Karthikeyan has been a valuable resource in my project and has performed remarkably well!”"

Now more than ever, companies must invest in consistent, understandable and defensible records management programs to structure the entire life cycle of information — from creation to destruction.

Retired from the Partnership, I am now acting as an independent Senior Deals Advisor and member of Boards and Advisory Committees. I have over 39 years of professional experience and over the last 25 years, I specialized in deal management, valuation and due diligence services. I assisted clients with domestic as well as cross-border and global transactions, ranging from mergers to acquisitions, scissions, carve-outs, disposals and restructuring. I advised clients on the full continuum of a transaction process, from strategy, over initial analysis of financial and operational performance, valuation and due diligence, through the assistance in structuring, negotiations and the determination of the final purchase price, to post-merger integration. I assisted already several local / family owned and foreign corporates, as well as local and foreign financial investors with transactions in Belgium and abroad, as well in private deals as auction processes and this within several industries. Further, I advised on public-to private and infrastructure transactions and supported local start- and scale-ups on their growth journey, including venturing advisory services to corporates.",

            "Shawn Horton “Charles worked with me on a very large customer project, as the implementation lead. He was absolutely essential in cultural change management with that group. He drove order from chaos, helping that customer to derive more value from their system. He lead the effort to establish formal, documented governance around data and content life cycle. Charles orchestrated involvement from other subject matter experts on his team and from product management, ensuring the customer had direct access to those involved in making changes to new products/features. He immediately established himself as a trusted adviser partner, and that customer would no doubt identify him as mission-critical to their success in that year-long endeavor. I was fortunate to work with Charles, and I would not hesitate to work with him in the future, if presented the opportunity to call him a teammate, again.”",
            "Don Shemanski “Charles Jelicks served as a Learning Assistant for me in two separate courses at Penn State University, beginning in the Fall Semester of 2013 in my course on the Role of Information and Intelligence. I was so impressed with Charles' abilities and work ethic that I hired him again in the Spring Semester of 2014 for my course on the Legal and Regulatory Environment of privacy and Information Security. Charles excelled in both jobs. Charles Jelicks is a classic self-starter, who makes sure that he clearly understands assignments and then carries them out efficiently and in a timely manner without the need for much hands-on supervision. He possesses first-rate drafting skills. His written work was invariably well-crafted, concise and error free. I was particularly impressed with Charles' ability to synthesize and organize voluminous and complex data cogently and effectively. Charles also possessed exemplary interpersonal skills. He particularly excelled in his role as liaison to the students in my courses, a role which included managing teams and team activities and in coaching and mentoring students. Charles Jelicks was without question one of the top two Learning Assistants (out of over 60) whom I have had the honor to work with during my time at Penn State. I recommend him enthusiastically and without any reservations.”"

            "Robert H. “I had the pleasure of working with Matt Wilden, who provided consulting services for our cybersecurity function. Matt was instrumental in developing our Cybersecurity Operations and Incident Response functions, leveraging his vast knowledge of cybersecurity to design and implement solutions tailored to our industry. His ability to bridge the gap between cybersecurity principles and industry-specific challenges ensured that our security framework was not only robust but also compliant with regulatory requirements and aligned with best practices. Matt’s deep expertise in cybersecurity governance, risk management, and compliance played a crucial role in shaping a program that met operational needs and regulatory obligations. He demonstrated an exceptional ability to interpret and apply industry standards, ensuring our solutions adhered to frameworks such as NIST, ISO 27001, and other relevant guidelines. His insights allowed us to address compliance challenges while proactively strengthening our overall security posture. Beyond his technical expertise, Matt brought a strategic mindset and a pragmatic approach to security investments. While he quickly identified additional tools and strategies that could enhance our security posture, he never pushed unnecessary solutions. Instead, he remained focused on aligning cybersecurity initiatives with our business objectives, budgetary constraints, and long-term goals. His ability to communicate complex security concepts in a way that resonated with both technical and executive stakeholders made him an invaluable asset to our team. I highly recommend Matt to any organization seeking a cybersecurity expert with a strong industry focus, deep regulatory knowledge, and a commitment to delivering practical, business-aligned security solutions. His contributions have had a lasting impact, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again in the future.”"

Now more than ever, companies must invest in consistent, understandable and defensible records management programs to structure the entire life cycle of information — from creation to destruction. The right technology is important, but “people challenges” often pose the biggest obstacles to success. Companies that anticipate and plan for these challenges are most likely to reap the benefits they seek from records management technology and process investments."

            "Bruno Squara “I worked very closely with Henning whilst retained by PwC Consulting during the past five years on a large PwC Partner-Director Sales High Performance Coaching program. Firstly as an individual Coachee on the program and secondly in tandem to that Henning was also the PwC Director responsible for the day to day role out and running of the program in addition to his role as Sales Director and subsequently as Director responsible for the growth of the PwC Advisory business in the East and West Markets and driving the One Africa theme for PwC Advisory. He participated and sat in all my numerous coaching workshops and was exposed to my own, other international and global PwC sales success thought leadership. Critically during these workshop discussions we strongly focused on the practical application of these critical sales success factors with the PwC Sales Function and important sales pursuits. Henning has strongly benefited from his five year program participation and he now has deep sales success factor insights along with the practical understanding of how to apply them with complex, large sales pursuits. It has been a pleasure to work with Henning and can attest that he has strong Sales Leadership qualities; he is an astute planner with excellent execution, is highly disciplined and very focused on achieving and delivering high performance outcomes and results. Furthermore he is a natural leader, salesperson and a very affable individual, exuding confidence with all that he works with. Henning’s passion for sport and fitness has also stood him in good stead and in addition he is an Executive Member of the Sharks / KZNRU Rugby and has been in that role for several years. I thoroughly enjoyed coaching and working with him! ”"

Me and my team provide commercial and technical due diligence services, as well as market outlook reviews for emerging sectors. I also have extensive experience managing a wide range stakeholders. In addition to catering to the specific needs of each individual client, I have assisted them to obtain finance by presenting business reviews to potential co-investors or financing parties, and implement post-deal advice to address business challenges faced by on-the-ground staff. My current areas of interest include the global deployment of green vehicles and reviewing the potential models which investors can adopt to optimize return on investments in electric vehicle charging or hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. In addition, I continue to enjoy working on projects involving public transportation solutions, cross-border asset portfolios, liquid bulk storage terminals and an eternally frustrating golf swing.",

Me and my team provide commercial and technical due diligence services, as well as market outlook reviews for emerging sectors. I also have extensive experience managing a wide range stakeholders. In addition to catering to the specific needs of each individual client, I have assisted them to obtain finance by presenting business reviews to potential co-investors or financing parties, and implement post-deal advice to address business challenges faced by on-the-ground staff. My current areas of interest include the global deployment of green vehicles and reviewing the potential models which investors can adopt to optimize return on investments in electric vehicle charging or hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. In addition, I continue to enjoy working on projects involving public transportation solutions, cross-border asset portfolios, liquid bulk storage terminals and an eternally frustrating golf swing.",

            "Peter Czerniawsky “Captain Snarzyk (ret. U.S. Army) Brian, to his friends and colleagues: brings his legacy as a \"member of the thin grey line\" with him in his briefcase and his heart to everything that he does. I do not believe that you could get Brian to do an unethical act under threat of death. He is an Executive that in the age of Enron, Andersen, MCI and Tyco his peers can only envy. I worked directly for Brian on an number of occasions but the engagement that I take greatest pride in is when Brian, who reported directly and had personal responsibility, under the immediate direction of Major General Peter Kind (ret. US Army): gave me sole responsibility for designing the \"National Disaster Information Technology Infrastructure\" for the President of the United States under executive order in the fall of 1998. Brian acted as my translator to the General and his team and was able to convey the extremely technically complex aspects of my design to the General in a manner that (as a non-technologist) he and his team were unable to grasp unaided. My design was based solely on the necessarily complex and highly technical design documents that the Presidential Executive Order Mandated. I consider Brian both a mentor and a friend and would not hesitate to provide him my professional services should he ever require my level of technical knowledge. Any organization would be doing their stock holders an extreme disservice by not meeting Brian's terms: no matter his requirements. Brian is man of both thought and action and should be given the highest respect for his past actions and his future potential; a potential that can only be expected to increase his standing in the Corporate and Government worlds of America.”"

              "description": "Many projects fail to fully realize their potential benefits due to three oversights. The insurance industry continues to invest heavily in transforming their legacy policy, billing and claims applications. But are carriers actually realizing what was promised to the business? Core transformation can be so much more than a legacy technologyreplacement.In our experience, many projects fail to fully realize their potential benefits due to three common oversights:Digitization without differentiation – Projects that simply upgrade their core systems but fail to change the customer engagement.Limited focus on information data – Too much focus on transactional data elements and not using a comprehensive informational data approach.Failure to foster innovation – Modernizing applications but failing to leverage these tools to support continuous improvement and innovation. In fact, 67% of insurance respondents to PwC’s 2017 CEO survey see digitalization and innovation as very important to their organizations. Specific to the insurance industry, CEOs noted that the area they would most like to strengthen to capitalize on growth opportunities is digital and technological capabilities, followed by customer experience (reflecting the connections between the two).Insurers are looking for more than just modernization of core systems. They expect a successful digital, analytics and organizational transformation that can enable them to unlock the full potential that a core transformation has provided to them. Carriers should be asking themselves the following questions to determine if they’re achieving the full benefits of expanding beyond core. Is the organization:Leveraging the new platform to change the customer engagement model?Leveraging analytics-based insights with a clear vision and plan to translate that into value based capabilities?Promoting continuing innovation – both internally and to customers?"

They also want digital and analytics platforms that can help them realize the full benefits of a core transformation. Insurers are getting ambitious with their transformation initiatives. Looking forward, a successful transformation should include broader strategies for 1) data analytics, 2) a positive digital customer and agent experience, and 3) underwriting efficiency."

              "description": "Building a business case for PAS transformation on market responsiveness alone can be a challenge. Executives often will demand verifiable benefits, complete with expense ratio and headcount reductions that justify the return on investment for what is a major initiative. While verifiable benefits are important, executives should realize that policy administration transformation also is a foundational investment that creates a launch pad for enabling new and innovative capabilities. With a modern platform, carriers can more efficiently and proactively respond to changing market demands instead of being passed by the competition."

              "date": "November 29, 2011",
              "description": "Improved operating leverage will provide the most direct and immediate benefits. Justifying the cost of a policy administration replacement can be a challenge for carriers because some of the benefits are indirect and don't surface until years later. For this reason, the case for a transformation isn't as straightforward as for other core systems transformations, like claims or billing.When building a business case for policy replacement, carriers usually look for quick and direct benefits in two areas: operating leverage and market agility. The prospects of improving operating leverage are particularly compelling to carriers because they often immediately impact the business, whereas market agility benefits take some time to realize as carriers identify new products and markets to enter. A PAS replacement can result in improvements to operational processing, eliminate redundant legacy systems, and increase IT delivery assurance, thereby enabling both immediate and long-term cost reductions. However, not all operating leverage related benefits are direct — in fact, in the long run, you may find that the indirect benefits have the largest impact on overall profitability."

              "description": "The convergence of aging legacy platforms, complex market demands, and a more mature vendor landscape have ushered in a unique period of policy administration transformation where it is possible for carriers to embark on this journey by taking on less risk than before but carriers who misinterpret the business drivers of their transformation programs risk firing at the wrong target.Before moving forward with a policy administration transformation, it's important for carriers to fully understand their business case, product mix, geographical presence, distribution channels, and overall market dynamics. Carriers planning policy administration transformation must evaluate specific business drivers as a diagnostic for assessing how a transformation will impact profitability."

          "about": "As a non-verbal kid, I spent my early years glued to the TV. Some of the first words I ever spoke were ad jingles. Marketing, quite literally, gave me my voice. I’ve been chasing the power of communication ever since. Today, I bring that voice into everything I do. Whether it’s building brand identities, mapping campaign strategy, or writing the words that shape a user journey. My work blends storytelling with structure: I’ve crafted media proposals, reimagined company decks, designed sitemaps and low-fi wireframes, built social campaigns, and developed buyer personas backed by deep research and competitive benchmarking. I’ve led projects, mentored teammates, and owned verticals. In my last role, I became a conceptual lead within weeks. I thrive in spaces where strategy meets sensitivity, where insight translates into action, and where creative systems are designed not just to look good, but drive impact. I think in stories because that’s where I come from. I once convinced a teacher I’d ridden a camel simply because I’d read about it in a Satyajit Ray novel. I hadn’t even seen a desert yet. That moment taught me something: narrative, when done right, can reshape reality. With a background in literature and a lifelong writing practice, I approach every project with a blend of empathy, elegance, and precision. I care about the rhythm of things: how language moves, how visuals feel, and how strategy aligns with soul. Off the clock, I’m improving my spoken French, shaping Urdu letters by hand, and writing poems when PowerPoint can’t quite hold the feeling. Some of my writing lives in a published Amazon anthology and other corners of the internet: it’s been shaping the way I build brands and tell stories long before I even knew what a brand was. Currently, I’m exploring opportunities in brand strategy and creative leadership — spaces where I can keep turning ideas into systems, and stories into action.

            "Sreyoshi Guha Thakurta “I had the pleasure of working with Shaoni for around four years, and in that time, she became one of the most dependable and quietly brilliant writers I’ve collaborated with. Shaoni has that rare mix of thoughtfulness and precision in her writing. She doesn’t just put words on a page: she listens, she thinks and she questions. Whether it was narrative-driven work, editorial pieces, or content with tight brand constraints, she brought clarity and depth every single time. She’s also incredibly easy to work with. She is very reliable, receptive to feedback, and thoughtful in ways that go beyond the brief. There were countless moments where her ability to just get it saved time and lifted the overall quality of the work. If you’re looking for someone who can think deeply, write beautifully, and bring calm competence to your team, Shaoni is your person. I’d work with her again in a heartbeat.”",
            "Debarshi Ghosh “I've had the pleasure of working alongside Shaoni Rakshit, and I can confidently say she's one of the most versatile and impactful content strategists I've met. Her ability to craft compelling brand narratives and develop sharp content strategies has directly contributed to rapid growth for several startups. What sets Shaoni apart is not just her command over content, but her cross-functional expertise. Whether it’s SEO optimization, market research, or shaping the bare-bones structure of a project from scratch—she steps in with insight, energy, and precision. Her talent for gathering scattered information and transforming it into a clear, actionable roadmap is remarkable. She doesn’t just write content; she builds strategy, brings in clients, and drives business outcomes. Any team would be lucky to have her.”"

Whether it was me sound-boarding projects I was the lead responsible for (e.g. Zero Waste Initiatives at Tepper and across Campus) or us working together on broader cross-cutting endeavors (e.g. Sustainable Careers, Force For Change Award, etc.), she was consistently coming at the micro details with the macro view in the forefront of the conversation. This enabled us to consistently tackle: how these endeavors meshed with where we wanted the Chapter to go, how they fit in amongst everything else we were doing, as well as how our stakeholders would value and respond to all of this. Carolyn has a natural eye for strategy and those who have the opportunity to work with her are sure to notice the value she brings to the table.”",

It began with the Deliotte case competition, which our team of four took first place, and continued through numerous finance classes. Any time I had the opportunity to put together a team, Carolyn was a first choice. Not only is she an excellent team player, but she also possess intangibles to help other team members relax and find their strong points.”"

Several studies have focused on users of desktop computers. However, few studies focus on access via mobile applications. Thus, there is a gap in understanding how the use of mobile applications to access Social Networking Services impact on the privacy-related behaviour of users. As a first step to cover this gap, this paper explores mobile user interfaces of various Facebook mobile applications in a systematic manner. Firstly a set of general user interface heuristic principles are identified from the literature. This set is then explored through a privacylens, deriving good practice heuristics for privacy features of applications. Finally, theprivacy features of the iOS, Android and Blackberry Facebook applications are evaluated using the derived list of privacy heuristics recommendations. The paper shows that numerous shortcomings exist within privacy features of Facebook mobile applications."
