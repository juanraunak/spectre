            "Tammy Duquette “Reporting to Erin over the last 18 months has been a privilege. Her passion, experience and customer first mind set contribute to her strong leadership in the digital space. She challenges the team everyday on how the work we are doing is bringing value to our customers and the organization. She cares about the people that work for her and takes the time to mentor and identify individual growth opportunities. Under her leadership I personally have learned more and grown more professionally than any time in my career.”",
            "Kayla Negrete “I had the pleasure of working under Erin’s leadership when she managed the Customer Experience Team at John Deere Financial. Erin is truly a visionary leader with a passion for Customer Experience. Many of the projects we worked on were on the front edge of what was developing within the Customer Experience industry. Erin was very instrumental in setting our Customer Experience Strategy; implemented the initial foundation of our Voice of the Customer work system and built out the framework for future phases. Now in her current role she has successfully taken the Voice of the Customer system globally. Erin is an extremely professional and articulate leader. She gets things done; she has amazing multi-tasking skills, sets clear objectives and timelines. In meetings she can cut through the usual politics and get directly to the right issues or questions that need to be raised. As an engaging presenter she is able to communicate effectively, articulating concepts using examples and gearing the message to the specific audience. Erin also cares deeply about developing the best in others. She frequently offered me suggestions and opportunities for my development. Her strong vision and high quality expectations drove me in new directions and helped me to further refine my strengths. Under her guidance I achieved one of my greatest successes; a re-design of our organization’s Experience Champions program. Erin provided the right level of direction and support, yet allowed me to be creative and take risks to push the envelope of our culture at the time. I highly recommend Erin as a manager and visionary leader.”"

              "description": "The efficient synthesis of small molecules having many molecular skeletons is an unsolved problem in diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS). We describe the development and application of a synthesis strategy that uses common reaction conditions to transform a collection of similar substrates into a collection of products having distinct molecular skeletons. The substrates have different appendages that pre-encode skeletal information, called σ-elements. This approach is analogous to the natural process of protein folding in which different primary sequences of amino acids are transformed into macromolecules having distinct three-dimensional structures under common folding conditions. Like σ-elements, the amino acid sequences pre-encode structural information. An advantage of using folding processes to generate skeletal diversity in DOS is that skeletal information can be pre-encoded into substrates in a combinatorial fashion, similar to the way protein structural information is pre-encoded combinatorially in polypeptide sequences, thus making it possible to generate skeletal diversity in an efficient manner. This efficiency was realized in the context of a fully encoded, split-pool synthesis of ∼1260 compounds potentially representing all possible combinations of building block, stereochemical, and skeletal diversity elements."

              "description": "AbstractLack of efficient access to collections of synthetic compounds that have skeletal diversity is a key bottleneck in the small-molecule discovery process. We report a synthesis strategy that involves transforming substrates with different appendages that pre-encode skeletal information, named σ elements, into products that have different skeletons with the use of common reaction conditions. With this approach, split-pool synthesis can be used to pre-encode skeletal diversity combinatorially and thereby generate such small molecules very efficiently. A split-pool synthesis of more than 1000 compounds produced overlapping, combinatorial matrices of molecular skeletons and appended building blocks in both enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms."

            "Cynthia Hale-Sain “I had the pleasure to work with Belinda from 2016 until 2021. Through her I learned so much about the global benefits space. She has mentored, taught and guided me through some of the more difficult global projects. I worked with her very closely on a global benefit admin project. She was tireless in working with one of our largest countries in implementing the system. She acted as project manager, knowledge base and facilitator to get the system up and running. She utilizes her analytical skills to quickly reduce large amounts of data into usable and actionable intelligence. She is a credit to any organization and I know that she will be successful in any role that she occupies in the future!”",
            "Thomas Weatherill “It’s rare that you come across standout talent like Belinda, few people have the opportunity to report to a manager who is also a coach and mentor—but I did when I worked for Belinda. ‘Ridiculously efficient’ is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about the projects I had the pleasure to work on with Belinda. I had the pleasure of working with Belinda for over ten years at Accenture, collaborating on several projects. Belinda expertly filled her role in the CoE benefits team and will be sorely missed. I was particularly impressed by Belinda’s ability to handle even the toughest benefit projects—effortlessly. Working with multinational benefit plans often takes years to develop among benefit professionals, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to her. I was always in awe of Belinda’s ability to command a room and get people on board with ideas—even people who were initially on completely different pages. Belinda’s ability to juggle multiple projects was unlike any I’ve seen before and made a dramatic difference in the productivity level of our team. We often had difficult messages to deliver to different groups within the company. However, no matter how tense a meeting, Belinda made sure everyone left with a smile. Belinda would be an asset to any team. As a team member or a leader, Belinda earns my highest recommendation. Any employee would be lucky to have Belinda as a manager. ”"

            "Justin Blair “Mike is without question, the most impressive IT consultant that we've worked with. Not only was he able to overhaul our entire network, he also made our system extremely user friendly. Mike applied his technical knowledge and expertise and simplified our system and way that we interact with our network into a user friendly and functional tool that operates the way that it should. Additionally, Mike has always been extremely reliable. Whenever something has come up, wherever he was, Mike came through for us. As an employer of a staff of 15, I'm confident that Mike would be a tremendous asset for any team.”",
            "Kevin Heins “As a manager: Mike provides a great experience everyday. He consistently challenges me to exceed expectations on projects. He provides great insight while also teaching me the skills I need. I feel that Mike is always looking our for my best interests and pushes me to projects that he knows that will be difficult, but ultimately a good learning experience for me. He has been a huge part of getting me involved with Sharepoint at Bain, even going as far as to showcase some of my work to others. He provides a democratic feeling for our group. He answers my questions immediately. If he can't answer them, he works his hardest to put me in touch with the person who can help me. Our group is always an open forum to suggestions on BDPs, dalily routines and other IT processes. As an IT specialist: When it comes to customer support, he provides it with confidence and timeliness. When he does not have the solution to an issue we are working on, he will go out and research it extensively. I have not once seen a customer dissappointed when dealing with him. He also creates a very friendly environment for our customers; many people come in just to ask about IT situations outside of Bain. As a planner for the future: Mike is always on the lookout for new ways to improve the user experience. He continues to drive new initiatives at Bain by introducing Web 2.0 enterprise practices to our group as well as Sharepoint.”"

            "Kala G. “Jason and I first connected through a shared context, and when the opportunity arose to experience the Positive Intelligence program under his guidance, I jumped at it. He is an exceptional communicator with a remarkable ability to listen deeply and articulate insights in a way that truly resonates. Jason’s generosity with his time and unwavering commitment to your growth leave no doubt about how deeply invested he is in your success. Week after week, he has facilitated an inclusive and safe space, meaningful, conversations, provided invaluable support, and cultivated a sense of trust that enables honest and transformative dialogue. Jason embodies the principles of Positive Intelligence and leads by example. I wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone seeking a compassionate and skilled coach who excels at connecting, communicating, and empowering others to realize their full potential.”",
            "Yesmin Rodríguez Nahum “I would say that Jason's arrival as Manager at Bain's Mexico office marked a turning point in my professional career. It was a long journey, and thanks to him, I was able to find a well-defined path. I learned to value what I was doing at that time, to change people’s perception of my work and performance, but above all, I began to notice changes in my self-confidence and sense of security. Jason knows perfectly how to lead by example and instill in people the drive to aim higher and not settle. He supports you, genuinely cares, but also challenges you to achieve new goals. From the moment I knew that he would no longer be my supervisor, the first thing that came to my mind was to ask him to accept me as his mentee. Even after some time of no longer working directly together, staying in touch with him and having his support has been very important to me. I have always said that he has a special touch, a \"sense of humanity\" that makes him truly unique.”"

Fierce competition among brands and thriftier shoppers mean that marketers can no longer grow a brand just by riding a category wave. Gaining market share is imperative, and market penetration is the primary way to achieve it, as we established in our 2012 and 2013 China Shopper Reports.For the third year, Bain & Company partnered with Kantar Worldpanel to study the shopping behaviors of 40,000 Chinese households. Our unconventional approach assigned research participants with barcode scanners to determine what they actually purchased, as opposed to what they said they had purchased.We studied 106 FMCG categories and analyzed in detail 26 categories spanning the four largest consumer goods sectors: personal care, home care, beverage and packaged food, which account for more than 80% of China’s FMCG market in value. Our study helped us gain invaluable insights into how shoppers make purchases in these 26 important consumer goods categories."

Chinese remain the largest nationality of luxury buyers worldwide, with purchases that make up for 29 percent of the global market, a four percentage point increase versus last year. At the same time, consumption in China is also shifting, with women’s categories and fashion becoming more prominent, as a result of Chinese shoppers becoming more sophisticated. These shifts are an extension of trends that began at the end of 2012; they are creating new imperatives for brands as they reexamine their operations in China from pricing, to customer relationships, to fashion content, and to local talent management."

At Bain & Company, I work with clients to build agentic AI systems that collaborate, adapt, and expand human capacity while embedding intelligence into action. My focus is on empowering the most curious, creative, and customer-obsessed decision-makers. That means increasing the volume and quality of data they can use, embedding best practices into everyday workflows, and reducing cognitive load so the next step becomes clearer and easier to act on with speed and confidence. I build solutions that move faster than traditional dashboards and embed best practices more effectively than slides or static tools. By prototyping and iterating early, we get real value into users’ hands faster and make it stick. I’ve applied this approach across retail domains including pricing, merchandising, supply chain, and customer strategy. From early pilots to embedded tools, I help teams bridge strategy and execution, surface insights that matter, and scale what works. I believe the next wave of AI in business will be shaped by how well we enable great people to see more, think better, and act faster with clarity.",

            "LinkedIn User “I have worked with Brock for almost a year and working under his leadership was very exciting and learning experience for me ! During my tenure with him he was taking care of Asia solutions spanning across multiple markets. I always stayed impressed and motivated with his help on the solutions I was working on. He always had great ideas to improve my segmentation projects from both the perspectives i.e. approach as well as strategic impact on clients' business. Brock was instrumental in bringing all the markets together in order to make the solutions better while making implementation across them easier. Due to this, we were able to drive multiple project streams together across all the markets and work in sync with market CEOs. His knowledge of solutions as well as people in organisation made it a perfect collaboration setup. It was helpful not only in the new projects but improving the existing ones. For me, his vast knowledge and experience is still unexplored. and I would love to gain knowledge more from him in future and will not want to miss opportunity to work with Brock !”",
            "Philip Glasgo “It's a pleasure to recommend Brock. He was a very motivated student and finished second in a class or 32 MBA's. He received a 100% on one of my essay exams, which happens about once every three years. For his overall academic excellence he was invited to join Beta Gamma Sigma, the business equivalent of Phi Beta Kappa.”"

At Bain, we know that leadership that is aligned, energized and open to new possibilities deliver results. To that end, growth and learning matter too – not just for the sake of it, but because our capacity to learn and grow can make the world better. I live at the juncture of those two things – leadership and learning put into practice. My passion is to help leaders and top teams get ready by developing the growth mindset, knowledge and skills to be successful. Over the last 20 years I've had the chance to work with many of the best leaders at many of the best companies in the world. I've also been a leader myself. I've seen what it takes and I know what it takes to keep leading, even when things aren't breaking your way. It's hard and in a world that feels increasingly unstable, it's more important than ever.",

He is regularly invited to speak at high-profile CEO events, including the WEF. He sits on the Botswana Economic Advisory Council and has extensive experience working with governments and NGOs (including the World Bank, IFC, EBRD) in developing markets.

            "Samuel Weaver, PhD, CFM, CMA “I first met Anna in an advisor/student relationship. I was extremely impressed with her international academic background as well as her rationale for obtaining this experience. In the Fall of 2008, I knew her in a faculty/student relationship. She was a top student in my Advanced Topics Class - Financial Management and Modeling. Anna impressed me with her individual abilities and “team” skills. From these projects, it was clear that she was an enthusiastic, organized self-starter. Her group (working with two other people) produced professional projects and well focused presentations. She has demonstrated leadership skills, but she can also share those responsibilities with her teammates and become a valuable team member. Anna has solid intellectual capabilities as demonstrated throughout the course work. My class is intended to be “finishing” class to crystallize a student’s theoretical understanding into practical application. This class is only for seniors and consists of some of the most talented, intelligent, and hard working seniors in the college. In addition, during class, she participated actively, asked well-pointed clarifying questions, and tried to relate our course material to her other classes and experiences. A number of her questions were very well thought out and got to the heart of an issue. Although our class had 45 students, I got to know Anna very well. We had separate conversations during my office hours. She is a very personable, friendly professional balanced with a drive to succeed. However, she would never consider doing anything to compromise the integrity of any situation. It is easy for me to provide a high recommendation for Anna.”",
            "Geraldo Vasconcellos “Anna has a first-rate analytical mind and the work ethic to match. She is a credit to Lehigh. I believe she will be very successful as a professional.”"

Actively inviting your toughest questions with giddy child-like excitement and unrelenting curiosity. Professionally, I aim to identify obsolete processes and turn them on their head. Personally, I try to inject a little bit of me into everything that I do. Otherwise, where’s the joy in it? Along the way, I have had the privilege of learning through the brilliance of incredible teammates, mentors, and friends; their guidance is what continues to fuel me and help me grow. I’ve been fortunate enough to wear a few different hats so far, gaining critical experience within sports, media, retail, and tech through work with leading global organizations.. I get most of my energy and fulfillment through the people I get to work with, but if I were to pick capabilities that excite me the most, I’d say: digital transformation, customer experience, operating model, and growth strategy. In my free time, I’m either running, sitting at a coffee shop, or impulsively traveling — all opportunities for me to overthink life and try to figure out what’s next.",

            "Andrew Patterson “Although brief, Alex made his time with us count and was a strategic asset to our team. His thoughtfulness in the approach to his work and his willingness to ask questions allowed him not only to learn quickly, but also to build our trust in his ability to take on challenging projects as well as bring him into client facing opportunities. Alex embraced the details and processes of our business, continually diving into new projects with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn from and work with others. Alex was mainly focused on social media and content strategy across major sports leagues, data analysis, and support of the growth and on-going relationships with the primary social media platforms. It was a personal and professional pleasure to have him on the team. ”",
            "Robbie Bach “Alex worked for me as one of two leaders exploring a new software application -- a piece of work where he showed strong initiative, judgment, and communications skills. This project involved a great deal of ambiguity and greenspace -- and Alex handled that with ease. He jumped right in to develop potential partners and clients. He led roughly 80 demos and informational calls with HR & Ops Execs from management consulting firms and various Fortune 500 companies, and entered 2021 with 3 companies ready to either trial the software or pursue follow up after some initial testing. This included companies like Nike, Accenture, and Dr. Pepper. Most of this strong work was done in a span of only 4 weeks. Alex set up the calls, closed each pitch, and handled any follow-up communication. Alex demonstrated maturity well beyond his experience -- I would highly recommend him and will gladly work with him on projects in the future.”"

          "about": "For almost 40 years I have been a student of business. I have worked alongside, and with, a long roster of great executives in companies large and very small. I have traveled the world, seeing how organizations cope with change, stress and opportunity in real time. I have been privileged to work on shop floors and in fancy boardrooms. My clients have had spectacular successes and in some cases equally spectacular disappointments. I have seen every management style. All the while, I have kept observing and learning. Here is what I think I know: 1). It all begins with people. Great companies have well-defined cultures that breed trust and collaboration. And culture starts at the top. If the CEO and his/her team don’t breath it and live it, the rest of the organization will know and wither. Every CEO should have a good coach. 2) Great business leaders have one common trait—they know what they want from their people (team) and they work tirelessly to put them in a position to be successful. 3) Industry structure and competitive position matter. A lot. Great managers can only do so much. In many industries, history and the development of competitive rivalry conspire to set the bounds on margins. 4) The truism that you manage what you measure is, well, true. We live in an odd world where companies simultaneously have too much data and not enough information. it takes time to understand what the relevant metrics are to manage a particular business. 5) Business communication is generally awful, and counterproductive. Too many words, leading to a lack of clarity. This is coupled with analysis that is akin to driving a car using the rear view mirror. 6) When an executive is not a good fit, the powers that be are almost always too slow to make a change. 7) My favorite metrics (all in the service of great resource allocation decisions): FCF, Household penetration, LTV-CAC, and ROIC. What am I missing?",

Not only is Rey a thorough professional and a pleasure to work with, his detailed knowledge of Salesforce made it very easy for the audit teams to get a good grip of the instance being audited. Rey is proactive about enforcing strong controls of the applications/ areas he manages and I am sure he will be an asset to any organization he works for. I surely will miss working with you Rey but wish you the very best!”"

While at Davidson, I studied psychology and economics, but my biggest accomplishment was snagging a selfie with Steph Curry. After graduation, I moved to Atlanta to begin work at Bain & Company. As a generalist consultant, I have experience across industries and capabilities. These experiences range from technology private equity due diligence to organizational transformation and redesign at a logistics company. No matter the case, I get energy each day from working through complex business challenges with a team. On my teams, I aim to be a source of positive energy and leadership for those I work with while consistently delivering results. Outside of my standard work responsibilities at Bain, I served as the Strategy Lead for Atlanta’s Womxn at Bain chapter, Bain Atlanta Inspire Office Head, and Class Culture Champion. In my spare time, I love to run distance races, read anything Reese Witherspoon recommends, and spend time with family and friends.",

            "Vin DiTullio, CPA “Teresa and I collaborated on many application development and deployment projects while at Bain. Teresa’s project management skills are superb and she quickly became a very trusted resource for me. She has a real knack for understanding all the intricacies and details of a project, while also being able to manage the project as a whole from 10,000 feet. She has an great appreciation for everyone’s workload and ensures a balance within the team as much as possible, but also realizes that bottlenecks are often inevitable and she works closely with that person to help move their tasks along (even pitching-in herself where applicable) in order to keep the project as a whole on schedule. Her interpersonal skills help to mold the project team into one cohesive unit, even though team members often have allocations to other projects that they must balance against. I would highly recommend Teresa as project leader or people manager in general.”"

            "Kathleen Hartnett “I had the pleasure of working closely with Emilie for the majority of her two year tenure at SapientRazorfish. In that time, Emilie quickly became one of my preferred strategy partners at the company. Working together primarily on large-scale digital business transformations, our work literally took us around the world. And in that time I got to see Emilie’s strengths in action, and came to rely on her as a true partner. Emilie is a dream team member - crazy smart, a compelling presenter in tough client situations, and has a critical eye for knowing where to place your bets. But more importantly, Emilie brings a sense of ideal pragmatism to her work that sets her apart from others. Anyone can be pie-in-the-sky, but Emilie was passionate about innovation and disruption that met real needs, added value, and could become a reality despite various conditions and challenges. Emilie grounds her thinking in truth from every angle, and that’s a refreshing construct to work within. As a team and a partner, that was the connective thread in everything Emilie did – so whether it was her late nights, challenges to clients, or when she pushed the team to take one more turn at an idea – it wasn’t about ego, it was about doing our best work so that we could really have an impact. Her work ethic, straightforward demeanor, and ability to keep calm in the eye of the storm are just some of the ways she helped lead our teams to success. Emilie is also one of those people whose curiosity doesn’t end at 5pm – she is always excited to tell you about the latest podcast she listened to, the latest case study she read, the latest trick she uncovered. Innovation is at the core of everything she’s excited about, and whatever she applies her excitement and intellect towards, she’ll be a force to be reckoned with. I look forward to the time we work together again, and in the meantime, can’t wait to see what she does next. ”",
            "Nicole Lehmann-Haupt “Emilie is an incredibly impressive strategic thinker who excels at developing unique solutions to complex problems through the utilization of cutting-edge technologies. She possesses the rare ability to forecast and understand the technical and creative realities of a project while simultaneously working with many clients at once to identify larger business opportunities on the horizon. Emilie is a natural problem solver and out-of-the-box creative thinker. She is a natural team leader, making her a valuable asset to any team. It is my pleasure to recommend Emilie, and I look forward to the possibility of working with her again in the future.”"

                  "description": "With Strive Consulting (now Launch Consulting Group), I joined a Data & Analytics division of a major US financial institution that struggled to introduce scalable agility in its development and delivery process. My original challenge was to turn around a struggling risk management program that was still in its early stages of automation and digital transformation. Having taken the role of an Agile program manager, I coached a resilient, cross-functional team, managed the delivery, operationalized the backlog management, and navigated a complex stakeholder landscape. The outcome was a multi-year success that spanned two major Initiatives, overdelivering in scope by ~60%, while staying on budget, producing next to no technical debt, and keeping the program's knowledge base & backlog future-ready.My other major accomplishment at the same client was taking a role of a Scrum of Scrums master for a major infrastructure and software upgrade initiative that required coordination of efforts of 1 vendor, 1 core DBA team, 4 major application development teams, and 8 interface systems. My role required heavy stakeholder management and complex cross-team and cross-functional coordination, while adding the much needed element of agility & resiliency to the otherwise waterfall (hybrid) project.Following that, I entered the field of human experience consulting for a digital transformation & data acceleration program in the public sector for a county-level Health & Human Services department. In that heavily client-facing role, I drove the functional workstream that provided a functional roadmap that resulted in a sale of further implementation.My most recent, ongoing role is a technical product manager for an ERP transformation within a US retail giant. I'm responsible for managing a portfolio of over 140 edge systems (external vendors) within various business areas in their re-integration with the new ERP, from development through testing to roll-out.",

            "Dejah Martin, CSPO “Chloe Ford is one of the best managers I think I will ever have in my life. I was one of her direct reports (out of 50!!) for a role she had taken that hadn’t waisted prior to. Upon meeting Chloe and my cohorts who she had also chosen for my very first apprenticeship, I was very timid and wasn’t sure how I was able to dress, wear my hair, or even how to be myself in a corporate setting. I was very insecure thinking that I had to “fit in” to be what the company wanted, and if I didn’t fit in? I would just be another summer apprentice. Chloe wouldn’t allow me or any of my other 49 cohorts however keep that mindset. She made it very clear to everyone that we were hand picked and special, she made me feel so deserving, a thought I initially didn’t even have for myself. Chloe is a go-getter who brings a smile to my face every time I think of her. When I think of Chloe Ford, I think of Super Woman. She will put her heart and soul into any and everything she sees potential in, and she won’t stop there either. Chloe has granted me with so much support, whether it be to join her company, to go elsewhere, and even just in life. I was very scared when my apprenticeship reporting to Chloe ended. I thought I would never really have the relationship with her again that was gained over the short 6 week summer. I was also very scared that I wouldn’t see her again and that I would have had probably the greatest summer of my life with some amazing people who are just like me, just to soon realize that I didn’t appreciate every second and ounce of information, care, love, and support enough that Chloe bestowed on my small inaugural group. I was so mistaken though. Chloe made a promise to herself in college where she wanted to work in a field where she could grant opportunities to college students just like myself, and she proves that promise to be kept every single day. I’ve never seen someone so devoted to helping others. Chloe is a giver. She is not selfish at all. She is so loyal, courageous, generous, and determined. A true Leo. She is a true icon, and I know she is destined for the world, and then some! She’s be one of the greatest assets anybody can have on their team. I hope to one day be half the woman Chloe Ford is. ”",
            "Justin T. “When I first met Chloe at an NC State career fair, I could tell she cared about more than filling roles at the company she represented. She cared about me, as a person, and wanted me to flourish in whatever endeavors I chose to pursue. Since our initial meeting, Chloe has been gracious enough to have numerous conversations with me about my goals and has advised me on decisions to accelerate my personal and professional development. I am so thankful to have Chloe as a mentor and look forward to seeing the positive impacts she continues to have on those around her.”"

After graduating with my Master's of Science, and spending some time in the research world, I realized that research science has its place in all industries. My skillset allowed me to jump into a people-focused team, aid in streamlining their processes, use historical data to promote performance, and overall create organized measurable results. Experienced in data management, customer service, and operations within the technical field. I believe that data can drive real change in any team environment. I've used my scientific background to help build programs and workflows for technical and business teams alike to streamline efforts and create efficiency in the workplace. Outside of work, my planning and preparedness doesn't stop. I love working on large scale logistics and creating unforgettable events for family and friends - these days, I've been focusing on a variety of fitness pursuits. I've co-captained a 70 person team for the Tough Mudder, captained a team of 12 in a 200 mile Ragnar Race across New Hampshire, directed my own personal marathon amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, and as of 2025 and diving (quite literally) into triathlon training!",

David’s fantastic drive, communication skills and being able to understand complex situations quickly, made him an amazing partner and I’m proud I got the chance to work with him — I hope we get to do it again!”"

We debated every issue and we always got to a better result because of that debate. In one year we delivered a rebrand working with the best agencies in the world, sunset three brands, renamed the products and launched a brand campaign. Oh and we rebuilt the website and had our first customer event in San Francisco. I would walk through any wall for Rishi.”",
            "Tamara McCleary “Artist + Data Scientist. What a breath of fresh air it is to work with a CMO who not only understands digital transformation, but knows how to execute and use his transformational leadership within an organization to inspire the troops and motivate not only internal customers, but external customers. I've had the pleasure of working with Rishi over the past three years and he is truly a transformative marketer who demonstrates his leadership on the cutting edge of marketing. Rishi has successfully harnessed the power of marketing technologies, and data analytics, to move the needle on the business bottomline. It's with great pleasure that I write this genuine recommendation as it's rare to find an executive level marketer that is both highly creative and exquisitely adept at not only speaking the language of digital, but possesses an in-depth knowledge and facility with the analytics aspect of the business.”"

Lori's extensive experience in consulting and the credit card industry led to innovative approaches to P&C industry analysis. The landscape of \"predictive modelling\" is to some extent in its early days in the P&C world but Lori's diversity of experiences was vital to approaching the complex area of predicting casualty risks in the future. I look forward to seeing how her company today will continue to enlighten those of us in the trenches on the trends of the future.”"

Behind Jon’s design talent is a penchant for continual improvement, a knack for finding solutions (think more technical, like sourcing and implementing a CMS), a versatility in style and medium, and a deep affection for design and UX work. He works hard with a sense of humor, he’s inspiring in his quest to better his work. If Jon is your designer, you’ll get great things.”",
            "Daniel Maschmeier “Jon led the charge for envisioning the Zest brand, worked closely with Marketing to design eye-catching pieces for social media, helped Sales to consolidate their message and pitch materials, and worked with the Development team to redesign the mobile application. All of this often times had ambiguous requirements and less than forgiving timelines. Jon is exceptionally creative and articulate, has a passion and drive that shows in the quality of his work, and has a capability of vision and collaboration to help bring everything together. I don’t think I could recommend him more highly.”"

After finishing my 2 years at Bain, I took some time to travel / work on independent projects before recently moving to New York City. I'm transitioning into a career in sports and interested in a number of different areas in the space. This includes 1) sports media, 2) investing and operating roles broadly encompassing sports / entertainment / health / wellness. In my free time, I love to talk, play, and watch sports (football, basketball, skiing, etc). I'm also known to memorize random sports facts (ask me literally anything about the Super Bowl!), tell people what day of the week they were born, and film videos of these pursuits. My email is bailydeeter@gmail.com and my Instagram and TikTok handles are @deetersports. Feel free to reach out!",

I support end-to-end Technology Strategy and Transformation programs to help organizations re-engineer their operating models & org structure, modernize their technology environments, and achieve measurable business outcomes in an increasingly digital world. I am a Certified CMMC Professional (CCP) with Certified CMMC Assessor (CCA) training through the CyberAB, enabling me to assess cybersecurity practices, including those within the DoD's Defense Industrial Base (DIB). I hold both a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and an M.S.E. in Statistics and Statistical Learning from Johns Hopkins University. My academic background has given me a deep understanding of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and mathematical models; I aim to understand how these methods can target organizational challenges, improve efficiency, and optimize data and infrastructure strategy. In my free time I love spending time with family and friends, exercising, writing, working on initiatives in the mental health space, and hanging out and being outside.",

            "Richard Dubnansky “LT Eric Quirk served with me on USS TENNESSEE (SSBN 734) from 2011 through 2014 when I was Commanding Officer. During that time, he was assigned to the positions of Electrical Division Officer, Tactical System Officer, Anti-Terrorism Officer, and most significantly, my Assistant Weapons Officer (AWEPS). As AWEPS he was responsible for the operation and maintenance of the TENNESSEE’s Strategic Weapons System as well as the personnel who operated it, under the policies and procedures required by the United States Strategic Command - clearly no small task. He excelled at these duties and demonstrated time and again his ability to manage personnel and equipment in routine, high priority and crisis situations. It is difficult to describe the magnitude of his duties as AWEPS. It is a position typically held by a Warrant Officer, who would himself have the backing of 15 to 20 years of technical experience. One of LT Quirk’s strengths was to be able to quickly grasp the technical details and therefore establish credibility amongst his men and with me. He quickly transitioned from a wet-behind-the-ears Junior Officer, to a seasoned Sailor that both his men and his Commanding Officer could trust for solid recommendations, exacting standards and good judgment. His inspiring leadership drove his team to be recognized as the best on the waterfront at SUBASE KINGS BAY and the personal recognition of him as the best Junior Officer AWEPS as well. It was both an honor and a privilege to have served alongside LT Quirk. On his uniform he wears the insignia of the Submarine Force, a set of “Dolphins.” When I presented those “Dolphins” to him, it signified that I trusted him with my ship and my crew. Before the crew, as a part of this fraternity, it signified that we could trust him with our lives. I can think of no higher endorsement that I could give him.”"

              "date": "Dec 2017",
              "description": "Today’s workforce understands that sitting all day is not healthy. As a result, employees are increasingly requesting more opportunities for movement throughout the workday. Workplace design has evolved to address sedentary behavior through active workstations, which allow individuals to experience the benefits of movement and posture change while engaging in productive work. Research on the health impacts of active workstations is well established, and most studies show an inverse relationship between the availability of active workstations and workers’ sedentary behavior. However, evidence of how these interventions impact employees beyond reducing sedentary behavior is still emerging. This paper contributes to this developing body of research by providing an overview of how active workstations affect an individual’s ability to effectively perform everyday job responsibilities. For the purposes of this paper, active workstations are defined as height-adjustable and treadmill desks. To explore the relationship between active workstations and employee effectiveness, a literature search was conducted. Articles were reviewed if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal within the past 10 years, analyzed more than just sedentary behavior, and were generalizable to the workplace. Findings suggest that height-adjustable desks have a neutral or positive impact on cognitive function and productivity/performance, and a positive impact on psychological outcomes, such as mood or energy levels. Research on the relationship between treadmill desks and employee effectiveness is still emerging, but preliminary evidence suggests that treadmill desks have a neutral or positive effect on cognitive function and psychological outcomes like boredom and satisfaction, and a mixed impact on productivity/performance. More robust, long-term studies are necessary to determine the impact that active workstations have on employee effectiveness over time."

He also can see the bigger picture. It’s his ability to balance high-level vision with low-level details that makes him so unique. He goes above and beyond expectations. It’s a joy to work with him. He’s also a great sounding board for new ideas and possibilities.”",

His ability to understand the context/need of a project or requirement is what leads to his work being on-point, on-time. He is truly unique in being that rare designer who can move from sketch to pixels to code all equally well. Get him working on something he's passionate about and the responsibility will now be on you and the team to keep up with him. I truly enjoyed my working relationship with him at Yerdle and the wit, perspective and kindness he brought to each day's new challenge.”"

          "about": "I’m Erin McCune, a payments and fintech consultant with 25+ years experience in global A2A, wholesale & B2B payments. Wholesale payments are all the unsexy stuff that comprises ~94% of global money movement, to the tune of more than $1,200 Trillion every year. They include settlement transactions between financial institutions, capital markets flows, payments to suppliers, payroll, and payouts to gig workers/other non-traditional recipients. SMBs represent a small proportion of the flows but are often higher margin. Similarly, relatively few transactions are cross-border but when they are, they are very lucrative. Over my career as a consultant, both independent and as a partner at Bain and Glenbrook, I’ve worked on hundreds of complex payments and fintech projects. My clients have been financial leaders of multinational companies; product managers nurturing development of new A2A, bill pay, and business solutions; bankers and processors, entrepreneurs and investors; as well as policy makers and eGov leaders. I’ve automated back office processes solving problems for vendors, customers, accounting teams, and sales teams. Over time, I realized that I just kept solving variations of the same problem over and over again. I founded Forte Fintech with a big ambition to solve the most challenging problems in B2B, bill pay, SMB finance, and payment infrastructure. Problems that won’t get solved at the product or business line level of organizations. Challenges that require collaboration across companies, the fragmented payments value chain, industries, and even geographic borders to solve. Intellectually, I like to figure out how things work, what motivates people and companies, and I enjoy hairy, seemingly intractable challenges. Following the money within and between financial operations has proven a great way to learn about companies of all sizes, a wide range of fascinating industries. I share what I’m learning here on LinkedIn and enjoy exchanging perspectives.",

She is a trustworthy and empathetic person with whom you can talk about anything related to your professional or personal challenges comfortably. I highly recommend Leena as a supervisor needed for everyone who is looking to make themselves better”.”",

In traveling to Bogotá, Colombia, and working for 2 education nonprofits for 5 months, I improved my Spanish, learned from a new environment and culture, and grew in appreciation for the dedication that nonprofit work requires. I start this new chapter in Boston with a renewed sense of purpose to learn how to be my best self as a new business professional. I am filled with gratitude for all those people and institutions that have supported me up to this point. Please feel free to reach out.",

She consistently pushed us and her team to think outside of the box and develop innovative strategies to drive incremental engagement from the Invaluable customer base. No matter how complex a given problem or idea became, Elizabeth always came up with a brilliant and actionable plan to execute against. I would love to work with her again and would absolutely recommend her as an outstanding asset to a team!”",

As I rise in my career and take on new reports, I continue to look to Elizabeth as a model manager.”"

He is a terrific collaborator and his intellectual curiosity enhances every contribution he makes. ”",
            "Hayes Roth “I met Brandon when he approached me after an NYU Stern lecture. I was struck then by his intelligent curiosity and even more by his diligent follow-up afterward-- conversations that ultimately resulted in a 9 month internship at Landor. There he impressed everyone with his ready willingness to offer help and, most importantly, deliver on whatever was asked in record time and always thoroughly and thoughtfully prepared. He became Ken Runkel's and my \"go-to-guy\" for category analyses and insightful client presentation help. It is hardly a surprise that he has progressed so rapidly in our industry since then as he focused on honing his strategic and client relationship chops. Brandon is the real deal and I hope we get a chance to work together again soon-- we always had fun and he made me look good! ”"
