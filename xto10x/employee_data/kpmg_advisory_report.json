Having served as Chief of Staff to KPMG’s US CEO and Chairman, I am able to bring the depth and breadth of a Global firm to my state and local community. I am focused on delivering strategy and transformation initiatives, underpinned by a foundation of integrity and personal core values. I have developed a robust ecosystem of local delivery partners, inclusive of SWaMs and technology alliances, committed to achieving long term success. Mentoring colleagues early in their careers is important to me, so I actively lead the KPMG network of Women, a firm initiative helping our female professionals grow. When not spending time connecting with new folks, you will find me on our “hobby farm” in Powhatan, in the garden, feeding the chickens and goats, or taking in the daily sunsets.",

            "Jenny Brusgul “Jeff and I worked together at KPMG in Advisory launching GTM campaigns, including content and insights. Jeff is one of the greatest leaders I've worked with - he is able to bring the best talents out of his team by empowering each individual to stretch his or her abilities and believe that the sky is the limit. Jeff is detail-oriented and rolls up his sleeves but he also can see the forest through the trees. Strategic thinking is a strong suit for Jeff and he also can execute well. Jeff always tries to bring a different perspective to every situation and challenge the status quo. A trait that I really admire about Jeff is that he is courageous and bold. He is not afraid to challenge leadership's thinking/ direction if he feels that it is not the right solution. Jeff will also go out of his way to speak up for his team and get the necessary resources needed to solve a problem. Lastly, Jeff has made an invaluable impact on my career and has helped me get to where I am today. Jeff, I will never forget your mentorship, guidance, and all the laughter we had together.”",
            "Theshan Goble “Jeff is an exceptional leader and a trusted advisor. He has an incredible ability to lead a team of experts that deliver cutting-edge content and insights that help clients navigate complex challenges and seize opportunities in the market. He is always looking for innovative ways to deliver value and impact to his clients and stakeholders. He is also a great mentor and coach who develops and empowers his people to achieve their full potential. He is a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend Jeff for any leadership role that requires strategic vision, operational excellence and people skills.”"

This was an extremely complex initiative, and Doug was responsible for defining the reengineered processes. He pulled together knowledge of production operations from dozens of countries, and hundreds of legacy systems, into a single process. Doug is an incredibly smart individual who is equally comfortable in a business or technical role. The Finance reengineering project succeeded in large measure as a result of Doug's intelligence and drive.”"

Throughout over 30 years at KPMG, I’ve been recognized for demonstrating excellence and innovation, leading and inspiring our people, living the firm's values, and collaborating across the U.S. firm and globally. I am passionate about solving big problems and listening to learn, and I enjoy working shoulder-to-shoulder with clients – helping them think through their strategies to address their biggest opportunities and challenges. In my time at KPMG, I have served high-profile financial services clients in various leadership capacities. Previously, I served as U.S. Consulting Leader, leading the transformation of the business operations and people processes of KPMG’s Consulting Service Group, reducing friction and improving performance. Prior to that, I was the national managing principal of the Advisory practice, leading our team in developing and evolving the Advisory strategy, guiding the firm’s investment program and overseeing client and engagement risk. The pace of change today is staggering, and to me, leading is about inviting disruption before it’s forced upon us. In this role, my driving priority is positioning KPMG for the future and building something even stronger for the next generation.",

I owe thanks for a lot of my growth in a corporate setting to the determination and support that Dallas has tirelessly provided in my last 6 of 12 years here. I can honestly say that without him, I would not have pushed myself to be the leader I am today. Not many people in a position like his can take the time to cultivate another person to fit a role like mine, but I watched him do it over a dozen times with many others while working for/with him.”",
            "Andy Barillas “Few people have the opportunity to report to a manager who is also a coach and mentor, but I did when I worked for Dallas. I had the pleasure of working under Dallas for over two years at Pack-Rat, collaborating on several project. I was particularly impressed by Dallas’ ability to handle even the toughest situations effortlessly. That skill often takes years to develop among a manager, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to him. No matter how tense a situation, Dallas made sure everyone had clear direction as to how our teams who move going forward. Any employee would be lucky to have Dallas as a manager!”"

In group projects Abraham is very open, easy to work with and provides meaningful feedback to others. His leadership capabilities are exemplified in his ability to build group consensus and steer the group in the right direction. I highly recommend Abraham and would jump at the chance to work with him again.”",
            "Allen Wright “I have worked with Abraham during the course of our MBA studies. First encounter was during our initial term as MBA students. Abraham is exceptionally talented and extremely diligent. Abraham is great with details and more importantly at extracting the information pertenent to the objective. Our second project was during our last term as MBA students. We were on the same consulting project team. Abraham was the critical component to our teams's first place finish. Without Abraham's detailed mind and exceptional organizationl skills we would not have completed the project in a timely fashion. Seldom would I risk my 20 year reputation on endorsing someone ... but Abraham Mohan is truly an outstanding individual and would be an asset to any company. Allen Wright”"

My expertise in risk management and technology allows me to identify potential vulnerabilities and develop solutions that mitigate those risks.

I am passionate about emerging technologies, specifically artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, cloud computing, and IoT. At the University of Miami, I work as a Project Manager at the Virtual Experiences Simulation Lab (VESL), where I help lead 8 unique and innovative projects. I am also a founding member and active brother of Kappa Theta Pi, the university’s first-ever professional technology fraternity. Additionally, I am a member of Beta Gamma Sigma International Business Honor Society and Order of Omega Greek Leadership Honor Society. For summer 2025, I will be joining KPMG as an Advisory Intern in Technology. After graduating, I aim to leverage technology to address complex business challenges and drive data-driven decision-making.",

I enjoy seeking out opportunities to better myself and gain new experiences. I have always set my standards high in work and in my personal life. I love being able to achieve things that I may be told I am not capable of. I am willing to take on any challenge / position necessary if it is what is best and needed. Pushing boundaries so I can improve and better myself is something I have always practiced. My minor in nonprofit management from O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University - Bloomington displays my passion for service. I am always looking for opportunities to give back as this is a large value I hold. I am passionate about making a difference and strive to leave this world in a better state than I found it.",
