A SAMPLE OF PAID WORK I HAVE DONE: delivered newspapers, shoveled snow, cut grass, hung drywall, tarred a roof, served as a dormitory resident assistant, stacked library books, programmed in FORTRAN, tested the M-1 tank simulator, ran credit checks, documented the manufacturing process for a jet engine part; answered mail for a Congressman, analyzed the federal budget and Clinton health care proposal, wrote speeches for a Senator, redesigned a company chart of accounts, developed emerging market growth strategies, developed a supply chain strategy, created leadership alignment forums, evaluated hospital purchasing processes, integrated two companies, evaluated acquisition targets, helped a company cope with email overload, conducted strategic scenario planning and sold lemonade. I BELIEVE: in the Holy Trinity ... that relationships are forged and strengthened in the moments that matter, and what you choose to do in those moments can make all the difference ... that the most important question in consulting is \"What problem are you trying to solve?\" ... it's okay to schedule naps ... the theory of constraints .. that watching the sun rise and set is a good for the soul ... and that life is too short to drink bad coffee. CONTACT ME WHEN YOU... need help framing a problem or talking through an issue ... are interested in discussing the moments that matter in life ... or just feel in your gut that it might make sense.",

Consequently, and this is not always a given, I see our team focused constructively on critical activities to enable success for those we serve while being good colleagues to one another.

              "description": "It's a truly exciting time to be working at the intersection of health care and artificial intelligence, and this conversation captured in the article really underscores that. My colleagues Neal Batra, Mike McCallen, and I had the distinct opportunity to sit down with Dr. Karen DeSalvo and Amy McDonough from Google – two leaders who are right at the forefront of applying cutting-edge technology to some of health care's most pressing challenges.From my vantage point as a Deloitte Health Care Applied AI leaders, the insights shared were particularly resonant. We delved into how technologies like generative AI, and increasingly agentic AI, are moving beyond hype and demonstrating tangible potential. Dr. DeSalvo painted a compelling picture of how AI can alleviate clinician burnout by tackling administrative burdens, accelerate crucial research like drug discovery through tools like AlphaFold, and democratize access to reliable health information for people everywhere. Amy McDonough provided a fascinating perspective on consumer empowerment. Her points about leveraging generative AI to help individuals navigate their complex health data – bridging the gap between clinical records and everyday wellness metrics captured by wearables – align closely with the shift we're seeing towards more personalized and proactive health management. Ultimately, this dialogue highlighted the immense possibilities when technological innovation meets deep health care expertise. It's about augmenting human capability, improving efficiency, personalizing experiences, and fostering a more integrated, continuous approach to health. The journey requires collaboration, a focus on responsible deployment, and a commitment to demonstrating real value, but the potential to transform health for both individuals and the system at large is clearer than ever. This piece effectively captures the essence of that transformative potential."

He is a manager's dream, and the type of individual that was always the first one in the office and the last to leave. Matt is the type of person that is not going to get out worked by his peers, and put full effort into everything he accomplished. He was consistently a top performer for the entire organization, and somebody i knew I could always count on to overachieve. Matt is highly skilled at finding ways to build rapport with his customers, and also with his virtual team. I continually received high praise from everybody Matt worked with, and I believe the future is extremely bright for him. I can't thank Matt enough for what he was able to contribute to the team, and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.”"

            "Michelle Gossett “Scott is everything you want in a co-worker/intern and more. From the day he stepped foot into the Marketing department at MarkLogic, Scott hit the ground running. No matter what we threw at him, Scott made sure to get it done. He asked questions when he needed to, met deadlines & communicated progress to team members. As his manager, I was most impressed by his ability to think critically and creatively – and he wasn’t afraid to question things. Scott knows that his voice and opinions add value and he’s not wrong. I am confident that Scott’s drive, knowledge and his willingness to take on any challenge will take him very far in life and recommend him with no hesitation. He would be a wonderful addition to any organization. ”",
            "Miguel Rodriguez “It was a pleasure to work with Scott, and we were lucky to have him as a Marketing intern. In his short time at MarkLogic, he made a definite impact on our Social Media program. He was the perfect mind for our Competitor Analysis Report - not only helping us to understand what our competition is doing, but also giving recommendation on how to get more social media engagement based on his findings. He also handled ad hoc requests, like video creation/editing for YouTube promos. Scott has an amazing personality, and co-workers become \"Scott fans\" very quickly. Fun to work with, down to earth, and eager to help - we'll miss Scott and his contributions to our team!”"

I am currently a Strategy & Change Senior Consultant focused on commercial modernization and go-to-market transformation at Deloitte. I am a hungry learner, currently focused on ecosystem approaches to better business, demand generation and lead nurturing, and innovative marketing trends. I thrive in complexity and ambiguity, hosting a track record of cross-functional experiences with a versatile skill set. Prior to Deloitte, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with degrees in Political Science and Media & Journalism with a specialization in Advertising, and a minor in Media & Technology Entrepreneurship. I value teamwork and am passionate about solving problems through strategic thinking and data-driven insights, always striving to bring fresh perspectives to the table. In additional to my professional work, I am devoted to engagement initiatives including leadership roles on the Greater Washington Area Women’s Leadership Initiative, Commercial Volunteer Council, and volunteer activities outside Deloitte through my residential neighborhood (Logan Circle, DC!) and United Way. On the personal front, I am an enthusiastic traveler, Spotify-obsessed, and just beginning to explore the world of film photography.",

Before going down this path, companies must understand their current business model from every angle. Take a moment to answer the following four questions and see how you measure up. Solving this puzzle will help determine how future consumption-based business models will address customer requirements and market shifts."

But before companies can transition to a pay-per-use model, they must understand their current business model from every angle–from their product portfolio to how they realize revenue. Companies need detailed answers to four important questions to determine how their future consumption-based business model will address customer requirements and market shifts."

But moving to a flexible consumption model is not for the faint of heart. It calls for sound strategy and a fundamentally different way of doing business. Explore the four paths that companies have typically taken to transition or expand to consumption-based models."

My passion lies in illuminating the full spectrum of Deloitte's capabilities and amplifying the profound, positive impact we deliver to our clients and the communities we serve. I'm driven by a singular goal: to empower our current and future clients, and our extraordinary professionals, with a deeper understanding of our unwavering commitment to excellence and societal advancement. When I’m not working with our incredible Deloitte Marketing team consisting of strategic marketers, designers, creatives, storytellers, architects, technologists, and communicators, you can find me supporting Daniel’s Music Foundation, cheering on my alma mater - Syracuse University, preparing for my next half or full marathon, cycling, and being with my family in New Jersey.",

During his time at World Avenue he did an excellent job of managing a staff of over 100 architects, developers, program managers an IT staff while maintaining several major off-site data centers. When Scott joined World Avenue he faced a project backlog of hundreds with a completion track record of only 10 to 20 per year. Scott put in a system of prioritization and resource allocation that allowed critical projects and program to move forward on a very timely basis. While at Selling Source, Scott identified internally developed \"competing\" efforts that had spent several million dollars without producing a result and was able to consolidate those efforts onto a single platform resulting in efforts for all future projects to be addressed and developed in a consistent manner. He instilled a professional process for evaluating and prioritizing requests and ensuring that those requests were consistent with senior management's direction. Overall, an outstanding job!”",

I don't believe in taking shortcuts and find that even the simplest tasks are powerful when done well. I enjoy building relationships with others while working through challenging situations that require adaptability and critical, deep thinking. I lead by example, build teams around individual strengths, and hold myself accountable while always assuming the best intent from others. I specialize in application modernization, helping clients realize their IT and business goals through technical solutions. My specialties are: o Rule Mining, including using automated software and techniques to extract business and technical rules from aging systems with limited documentation and diminishing workforce o Legacy System Operations, especially complex systems with opportunity to incrementally modernize or improve the posture of the application o Modernization Roadmaps, including legacy system analysis, modernization approach assessment, defining target state architectural visions, and defining incremental steps towards modernization",

Our simple methodology generates “policy forecast errors” which have a direct interpretation for the impact of forecast errors on the target interest rate given by the Taylor rule. Without interest rate smoothing, we find that, on average, the Taylor rule target interest rate would have been approximately a full percentage point away from the intended target because of errors in forecasting output growth and inflation. Our results are robust to changes in the forecast horizon and to changes in the weights on the variables in the policy rule."

A principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP for almost two decades, what I enjoy most about my work at Deloitte is playing an active role in developing the next generation of leaders, and introducing solutions to the market that drive business outcomes. We are in the age of robotics, cognitive, big data, analytics and to be on a forefront of such a powerful market dynamic is both humbling and exciting… the ability to drive human-machine relationships is an especially exciting challenge. Born and raised in Connecticut, I attended the University of Pennsylvania, played college football, and later got my MBA at their Wharton School of Business. I continue to value the educational ecosystem I experienced and have given back by coaching now more than 30 youth sports teams over the last ten years, impacting around 300 kids and their families.",

Long Story: If you know me, you won’t be surprised by the fact that I started talking at the 1 year mark. The gift of the gab never took a break. From joining the debate team to being the editor of my high school newspaper, my passion has always been rooted in communication and it’s still at the core of my professional career. Getting to know the people you’re working with, working for and joining on a team, to me, are essential keys to success. I also believe that your personal life and professional life work together – each fuels the other. So my journey has included moving to new cities, taking on new opportunities and immersing myself in the cultural experiences around me. Each role in my career has taught me something that I’ve built on and brought to the next. My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself: • I’m an Organizing geek: files, spreadsheets, clear bins…. • Problem solving fuels me: What is the challenge? Let’s start brainstorming and get creative. • Positive acknowledgement and praise for my contributions go a long way and help me stay engaged. • Lifelong Learning is my jam (and peanut butter): learning keeps me curious, engaged and ready for the next adventure. Recruiting for Deloitte is a win-win scenario where I get to meet a variety of people daily, assist in the growth of our businesses while also contributing positively to professional journeys.",

In my 2 years that I worked for Amit, he showed me the right skills and capabilities needed to truly be an effective management consultant. The in-depth experience he had in the Big Management Consulting firms was a true asset to have and highlighted the breadth of advisory we provided to our clients. Amit highlighted to me very early on that as a consultant the firm was built on the backs of our clients and that we had to ensure we were respectful and to provide as much support to them as best we could. The leadership I had and the mentorship was second to none at the firm and I truly appreciated my time with Amit and the continued relationship we have today.”"

I have found him to be very respectful and very thoughtful. He is greatly valued member of our extended teams and I look to him to be the thought leader that he is.”",

As a student, I sometimes felt like professors went too easy on us, making it easy to cut corners. Scott was the first professor that really pushed me. I had absolutely no clue what design thinking really meant when I began his course. By the end, it was a part of my every day... and later, a big part of every job I've had. Now, I run my own company and continue to draw from his teachings and advice. I still refer to him as one of my most inspiring teachers. P.s. Scott was MY professor. LinkedIn didn't offer that as an option for some reason. ”"

Most of all the willingness to go the extra step to make sure that those he was supervising were taken care of. Not once did a request or a problem occur that Jason was not quickly able to handle in a professional and kind manner. Beyond his superior abilities as a supervisor Jason has more experience and solid knowledge than many those of in his field. His intelligence and expertise have prevented future problems from occurring and quickly solving those that did occur. I would recommend Jason Williamson for any position that he felt he was able to accomplish, because if Jason thinks he can do it, then he can do it and make it look easy.”",
            "LinkedIn User “I employed Jason Williamson during a critical phase of our company's growth. We found that our business was relying more heavily on the IT aspect of operation, but we were not staffed to make the leap, nor were we resourced to hire the necessary staff full time. Mr. Williamson began with a thorough assessment of our existing operation, strategic goals, budget, IT-specific needs. He then worked with us over the next two weeks to formulate a comprehensive IT plan, spent time with our in-house IT staff to initiate the project, develop policies and procedures, develop and implement a security plan, and put us in contact with people and companies to help make it a reality. Additionally, he took the time to follow up and make sure that the project continued to completion, offering help when necessary. Overall, his help allowed our company to formalize and strengthen our IT operation, and placed the business in a better position to move forward without the liability of a weak IT operation. Highly recommended.”"

Additionally, rich viewer-controlled personal preference data in turn increases the value of subscription and advertising revenue streams. However, there is a growing and competing tension between content distributors’ desire to serve precise and meaningful recommendations for viewers and viewers’ willingness to allow access to their personal data, especially to unknown or untrusted organizations. The emerging need for content providers is to have a more comprehensive understanding of audience preferences and for viewers the ability to carry their preferences across all content providers. To address these needs, a secure privacy-assured mechanism to support rapid transparent use of data would address these competing tensions. Today, neither a technical solution nor protocol standard exist to support this vision. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of a data rich, viewer controlled content personalization ecosystem.Keywords. audience segmentation, cloud, content stitching, content provider agents, content recommendation, content relevance, content staging, content targeting, compelling content, data ownership, edge services, relevant advertising, personal profile, personalized production, personalized programming, viewer agents, viewer control, viewer preference identification"

              "description": "Educating management students in technology-based disciplines can be enhanced through experiential team projects simulating the activities employees perform in actual technology jobs. This paper describes an experiential team project the authors use in the Management Information Systems course at Boston College. The project was developed jointly by Boston College faculty and consultants from the Boston office of a major consulting firm. The project involves student teams playing the roles of IT consultants who must compete against one another to win a consulting engagement at an imaginary company."

This technology has been leveraged by many technology manufacturers who have equipped mobile phones with assistants in addition to building products for the home. The ability to tie in to other technologies, thereby allowing voice-driven automation, has captured consumer mind space and share of wallet.In a technology space that is becoming rapidly crowded, different industry players are forming alliances with the objective of staving off competition. It is no surprise that major hospitality industry players have been exploring opportunities to leverage voice recognition technology as well."

This practice not only recognizes loyal and frequent customers, but also serves as a marketing tool to entice new customers with attractive rewards. However, existing loyalty management systems haven’t been able to aid the aggressive market growth owing to inherent issues like disparate data sources, inefficient systems, unattractive reward points, delayed redemptions, security threats and overdrawn settlement processes. Loyalty management systems can greatly benefit from a unified platform that provides a 360-degree view to the customers at near real-time speed."

She has helped to grow the team from a small group of less than 20 practitioners to what is now over 200 people strong, expanding our wide range of analytics abilities and expertise. Her efforts in the Healthcare Provider space in particular have resulted in many happy clients and a continuously growing list of projects and opportunities for the team to work on. I have also seen firsthand her deep appreciation and caring for our team within the Studio that she leads. She is not only a strong engagement leader, but also a mentor and a role model for the more junior members of the team. She provides career guidance, growth opportunities, and constructive feedback to the many practitioners that look to her as their leader. She is a significant leader on the Studio team and her impact is evident in the growth and success of this group.”",
            "Kevin Nelson “Supporting Babette was one of the most valuable experiences in my Healthcare Consulting career. We delivered various projects spanning 2 years at Deloitte Consulting. I can first-hand endorse her ability to build a strong team culture and develop others in the midst of delivering complex and high quality projects/deliverables for our clients. Her leadership and project delivery are clear strengths, but it is her ability to think creatively and innovate that set her apart. Babette does not settle for the status quo or for a \"cookie cutter\" solution; rather, she always thinks and delivers at the next level. Why settle for a slightly improved process when you can develop a new and automated process? Why simply provide an assessment when you can discover and solve for the root cause? Working with an innovative leader like Babette was refreshing, changed the way I approach and solve problems, and helped shape the professional I am today. I highly recommend Babette and would welcome the opportunity to work with her in the future.”"

Hence, it's with pleasure that I can recommend Matt: he's the rare recruiter who not only does what he says he'll do, but he's also extremely pleasant. In fact, he's one of the most affable recruiters with whom I've ever been in contact. To boot, he's highly professional and thorough; when he reaches out to me, it's always with an opportunity that matches where I am in my career, and I appreciate the fact that he's selective in that fashion. I believe you'll have experiences that are similar to mine, and with that in mind, I'm happy to recommend Matt to you and your colleagues.”",

            "Sophia Nelson “I had the opportunity to work with Jenny for six months during the design phase of a Global Business Services transformation for a Fortune 500 Life Sciences / Pharma client. As my manager, Jenny demonstrated outstanding leadership abilities by communicating clearly and effectively, offering support in a number of different ways and enabling each member of the team to exceed expectations both internally and with the client. As a Senior Manager at Deloitte, Jenny had a number of competing priorities, including managing multiple projects outside of the one we were on, which meant we often worked virtually together, even so, she took several actions right away to ensure that I was set up for success. Some examples included: 1) matching me with a 'peer mentor', someone which I could ask questions or share ideas in a safe environment, 2) sharing sample deliverables to clearly demonstrate the direction or standard she expected--which is particularly helpful when working virtually 3) providing consistent and structured feedback--with each interaction she would articulate the positives of a deliverable and areas of opportunity--this continuous stream of feedback not only helped me to grow but also allowed us to find a rhythm of working together in a quick and efficient manner. While Jenny has a take-charge personality coupled with high standards, she truly cares about her teams and enables them to own and lead their workstreams.”",
            "Keri Robertson Morelock “Jenny teaches, guides, and delivers. Whether in service to her clients or to her project teams, her approach as a consultant is focused on making those around her better. Jenny’s ability to provide mentorship is truly exceptional. She consistently takes the time to help her teams grow and push themselves. Jenny is a natural leader and teacher and it is clear that she takes these roles seriously. Jenny also casts a wide net– I have seen her provide mentorship to practitioners across our organization in both a consistent and highly effective manner. Jenny’s ability to enable others to excel extends beyond her project teams. Her approach to client service is not just to deliver an idea, but to partner with her clients and provide perspective and expertise that helps them to develop a practical and impactful solution that addresses their organization’s needs. Finally, throughout my two years of working with Jenny, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to get results – she is able to organize and understand large amounts of nuanced data to provide outstanding client service that consistently generates impactful solutions. It is truly rare to come across someone as talented as Jenny. ”"

Across health plans, health care providers, and life sciences organizations, the move to a no-collar workforce creates a compelling opportunity to improve clinical outcomes, reduce per capita costs, enhance the patient experience, and create a more fulfilling and effective workforce."

However, there are opportunities to reverse this trend, which will require new ways of working and a complete digital transformation to unlock R&D productivity and deliver the next generation of scientific breakthroughs.This ninth annual study by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions analyzes the return on investment that 12 large cap biopharma companies expect to achieve from their late-stage pipelines, along with four smaller, more specialized companies for comparison. As well as the core analysis, the report also provides recommendations of how the future of work, who does it, and where it gets done, can help companies to unlock R&D productivity."

            "Emma Scales “Julie is one of the most talent Learning Professionals I have come across in my career. Her ability to partner with senior leaders, deliver to exacting standards, and produce curricula that resonates globally, is unparalleled. She is a passionate person, full of ideas, lateral thinking and high-standards. This combination has made her a trusted partner to leaders from all crafts and industries from countries around the world. I have watched her coach, develop and mentor strategists, facilitators, technologists, executives, and instructional designers across the world. Her focus on developing their unique capabilities and personal strengths, not gaps, has helped many people to progress significantly in their careers. Personally, I still turn to Julie for advice and inspiration. She has always been a source of honest and insightful perspective that helps focus whatever I am doing on what is critical. She is an asset to any organisation, and a true leader within the learning profession. ”",
            "Amy Ingram “Julie is a powerhouse. While at Aquent, I worked with her in a several capacities, first as a manager--one of her customers/stakeholders. In that role, I turned to Julie to help get new hires ramped up, sought her on a consultative basis to help with performance issues and just-in-time training for my team on new processes and initiatives. Julie's expertise and guidance was always right on point and helped me get new folks ramped up seamlessly and quickly. I also worked closely with Julie as part of an internal task force launching our national referral program. Julie not only provided a well-thought out plan for getting our message to right audiences; she also delivered an amazing volume of internal training materials (job aids, interactive online training modules, live launch calls) in a very short period of time. Lastly, I worked her for an unfortunately brief period of time as a Learning Services Manager at Aquent. In that brief time, I learned an incredible amount just by following and listening in her wake. I was and am in awe at the workload Julie manages without batting an eye. She ROCKS.”"

That was their world. However, with the ascendance of cloud, that world has changed. Architects are now expected to be just as smart and agile as the applications they build. In this episode, David Linthicum and guest, Deloitte’s Vasa Vishveshwara, discuss the ever-changing, ever-expanding role of the system architect in the world built by cloud. According to Vasa, architects have to be just as well-versed in the business as they are in cloud technology. And, to stay relevant, they have to hone their communication skills and continuously expand their knowledge base—both from a business and technical perspective."

            "Umair Marfani “Samrat joined the General Electric Production Solutions (Artificial Lift) business as the marketing leader during challenging times while the industry was in the midst of a sustained downturn and the business was experiencing restructuring and leadership changes. He quickly gained the trust of the business CEO and Production Solutions staff, allowing him to put customer needs and value proposition at the center of the business strategy and decision making framework. This enabled the business to make quick decisions on the strategy going forward including capital allocation (what to fund, what to kill), and new technology development. A natural problem solver with a structured approach who is willing to roll-up his sleeves and move things forward. Has the ability to see the big picture and understand how the different pieces fit together to create value for the customer and returns for the business. A great team player and a lot of fun to work with, was fortunate to have him be part of the team ”",
            "Kevin Gaumard “I have known Samrat professionally for over six years, first as a management consultant and then a colleague at NextEra Energy. At NextEra, he consistently delivered upon financial and operational targets by leveraging his deep Oil and Gas expertise while successfully managing the relationship with external partners. As a management consultant, through all his engagements, he showed excellent problem diagnosis, outside of the box thinking, communication and leadership skills earning the respect of his team and clients. More importantly he is an even better person to work with”"

Because of this, I am very flexible in terms of knowledge and ability, which I think is indispensable in today's increasingly tech-centric environment. As new technologies - and in turn, new industries - emerge, I can easily adapt and leverage newly acquired knowledge and skills. Of course, the ability to learn quickly and effectively can apply in many other aspects of my work life; technology is just one facet. I am passionate about working in the tech industry, and I honestly have fun and feel at home in that environment. I am a problem solver at heart. Wrestling with problems to come up with efficient, effective answers is very stimulating for me, as is actually seeing my actions benefit other parts of my organization. There's also always a massive bonus if I have the ability to utilize my creativity to solve problems, as I love being creative as well.",

We have had the absolute privilege of having Federico on our team for the past year. He joined our team in a provisioning role and quickly picked up this complex, dense role and made it look easy. He tackled projects and tasks that were well beyond the expected duties of an intern and outperformed our greatest expectations. Halfway through his year with us, another team requested that he join them for a short period which quickly turned into a few months because they didn't want to give him back. :) On both teams, Federico filled and excelled in roles that were full-time roles which require a degree and previous experience. We are so sad to see him go but could not be more happy for him to move on to bigger and better things. Thank you, Federico, for being such a wonderful part of our team and for working so hard for us. You are truly appreciated for all that you are. ”"

Last year was the first that our club integrated any electronics or active data collection hardware on a vehicle. This year we are turning that to 11. We are integrating many more sensors (redesigned fuel gauge, brake pressure, engine RPM, gearbox RPM, and more). The sensor data is recorded on-vehicle while also connecting to a driver display mobile app through Bluetooth Low Energy to display values in real-time. These values are also sent to a database over a cellular connection so that they may be seen in real-time by offtrack observers. If you'd like to learn more about the team you can find our website here: https://www.ncstatebaja.com/."

Overall, I had a ton of fun working on the project and learning from it."

This was probably the impetus behind starting my career as an engineer. I have worn many hats throughout my career – programmer, operation researcher, product designer, data analysis engineer and business consultant. This has enabled me to develop multi-faceted solutions using diverse concepts while managing multi-disciplinary projects. Everybody sees the world through their own experiences; I see the world as an opportunity to build better organizations aligning people, process and technology with strategy. - I love leading development of solutions to business needs. - I care who gets the credit, the team gets the credit. - If I can’t measure it, I can’t align, manage or improve it; I can measure anything. - I develop new methodologies to solve business problems, and I execute them. I enjoy fostering relationships with clients, co-workers, industry experts or just to hear new experiences. If you are interested and would like a sounding board or discuss new ideas, just reach out! Specialties: Functional - Business Process Reengineering, Organizational Effectiveness, Change Management, Performance Management, Data Analytics, IT requirements and Business Development. Markets – Public Sector culture and strategies, Human Resource Processes covering Compensation, Benefits and Staff Engagement.",

Now back at Deloitte, I have worn many hats in my recruiting role over the last several years and I look forward to continuing to work with both students and colleagues from all over the country, each with their own Why Deloitte story. Outside of my professional role, I love long distance running, taking endless pictures of my dog, and working part-time as a Pilates instructor in Austin.",

After starting my career at Deloitte working as a Consultant for four years, I transitioned into the world of higher education and career coaching while pursuing my Masters of Higher Education at the University of Texas at Austin. Now back at Deloitte, I have worn many hats in my recruiting role over the last several years and I look forward to continuing to work with both students and colleagues from all over the country, each with their own Why Deloitte story. Outside of my professional role, I love long distance running, taking endless pictures of my dog, and working part-time as a Pilates instructor in Austin.",

As a result, many sellers and buyers are experiencing significant frustration with the B2B payments process. And while financial institutions1 (FIs) are increasingly targeting middle market growth opportunities, they could do more to address the segment’s payments pain points.If FIs plan to tap into this new pathway for growth, their B2B payments offerings should help middle market companies manage broader business and growth challenges along with addressing specific payments pain points. This dual focus will become increasingly important as the US modernizes its payments infrastructure, core processing capabilities become commoditized, and disruptive newcomers move quickly to try to grab the lion’s share of this promising market."

These questions aren’t just for technology leaders. They span the C-Suite.

            "Quinnetta Daniels “Sailor has proven to be a dedicated, innovative colleague. In my experiences working with them in various groups- particularly within the Diversity & Inclusion Committee, I have witnessed Sailor advocate for underserved and underrepresented groups. Through Sailor's research and thorough presentation, myself and staff have a new understanding of the LGBTQAI+ community and it's needs. Sailor is organized and persistent in the work, without fail. I have yet to witness them miss a deadline or deliverable. They are willing and flexible-- I thoroughly enjoyed working with Sailor. I highly recommend Sailor based on their work ethic, passion, and vigor with the work and the communities by which we serve. Please contact me personally for more information. ”"

He possesses excellent leadership skills that I have personally experienced. He would lead by example by guiding me through the client deliverables and firm initiatives that we would work on together. Although he spends the time to help teach and mentor others, he would still find time to get the job done for the client. Patrick challenges junior practitioners that he works with to grow by asking them to think about solutions to problems with depth and rigor. This left a lasting impact on me since I was well-prepared compared to my peers to take on a client role beyond my level. I look forward to any future opportunities to partner with Patrick.”"

At the time I still wasn’t old enough to drive but I kept the car looking like new. One afternoon a family friend came over while I was finishing detailing the Jeep impressed by how clean my Jeep was he asked: “if I paid you would you detail my car?” Without hesitation I agreed. By word of mouth I soon had several customers and I named my new car detailing business Alpine Auto-detailing. I learned a lot detailing cars for five summers as the business matured and grew each year. I started my own website, launched a small marketing campaign, and learned the how to manage costs and pricing. The list of takeaways from this experience goes on but the most important lesson I learned was hard work and great customer service are the key to success.",
