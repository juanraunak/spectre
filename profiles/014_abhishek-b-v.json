Not to talk about the buzz, but to help companies move from curiosity to real deployment.\n\nThat means understanding how GenAI can drive measurable impact across functions: product, engineering, sales, customer support, marketing, and more. It also means understanding what’s hype and what’s real.\n\nWe have kickstarted several projects that may significantly increase the pace of Gen AI adoption in the ecosystem. We’re looking to partner with mission aligned individuals: experts who’ve helped companies deploy GenAI in live workflows or builders who have coached teams on the practical nuances of adopting Gen AI in the workplace.\n\nIf this sounds like you or someone you know, please DM me. We would love to learn from your experience and explore meaningful collaborations.\n…more\n64\n2 comments\n4 reposts\nAbhishek B V reposted this\nEng. Abdulrahman Alsmail\nEng.
