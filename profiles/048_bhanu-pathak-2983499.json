Over the past 18 years, I’ve helped category-defining companies — from Flipkart and Udaan to Tata Digital and xto10x — go from zero to high-scale with strong P&L ownership and cross-functional leadership.\n\nAt xto10x, I lead Academy Programs that help high-intent startups move from product-market fit to IPO readiness through structured interventions, deep operating work, and international expansion — including xto10x’s entry into Saudi/MENA.\n\nPreviously, I was Chief Business Officer at Tata Digital, where I helped scale the Tata Neu super-app across grocery, health, fashion, and jewelry.\n\nAs a founding team member at Udaan, I built and led the Food (Staples/FMCG) business from scratch to a $1B+ GMV run rate, and later led innovation in offline retail and quick commerce.\n\nAt Flipkart, I spent ~4 years in leadership roles across category, business finance, and supply chain — helping shape the early infrastructure of Indian e-commerce.\n\nI began my career at P&G and J&J, managing large-format trade, launching national shopper marketing programs, and building out the trade marketing function for JJVC India.\n…see more\nActivity\nActivity\n5,973 followers\n5,973 followers\nFollow\nPosts\nComments\nImages\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nBhanu Pathak\nBhanu Pathak\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nCXO | Consumer-Tech & Marketplace Leader | xto10x | Tata Neu | Founding Team @ Udaan | Flipkart | P&G | J&J\nCXO | Consumer-Tech & Marketplace Leader | xto10x | Tata Neu | Founding Team @ Udaan | Flipkart | P&G | J&J\n1w • \n 1 week ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nGrateful to have moderated a panel at VIBE Summit yesterday on how and where GenAI is already creating impact in consumer tech.\nThanks to my fellow panelists from() and Tata Digital() for bringing sharp, real-world perspectives.\nI had the tough job of going right after— and came away from his talk both impressed and super curious.\nSpecial thanks toat Upekkha for the conversations while putting this together.\nwas glad to be a knowledge partner for the event.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/2\nActivate to view larger image,\n94\n4 comments\nBhanu Pathak\nBhanu Pathak\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nCXO | Consumer-Tech & Marketplace Leader | xto10x | Tata Neu | Founding Team @ Udaan | Flipkart | P&G | J&J\nCXO | Consumer-Tech & Marketplace Leader | xto10x | Tata Neu | Founding Team @ Udaan | Flipkart | P&G | J&J\n1w • \n 1 week ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nLooking forward to moderating a conversation on AI in Consumer Tech at VIBE Summit in Bangalore tomorrow at Leela Palace.\nA good excuse to step back and ask — what’s actually working, what isn’t, and what might matter next.
