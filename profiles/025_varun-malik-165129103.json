And, on 9th Feb ‘22, Binny topped the company up with $25M in funding (from his own pocket). We don’t have latest data on company performance, since it is SG domiciled, but FY23 was ~$14M in revenue & profitable.\n\nxto10x combines the traditional ‘McKinsey model’ i.e. consulting (70% of revenue) with a ‘builders approach’ i.e. product / software led engagements (30% of revenue)\n\n“PeopleCues” is their software platform, priced at ~$8 per seat per month, which comprises\n\n(a) OKR management\n(b) Performance management\n(c) Culture & Employee NPS (eNPS)\n\nIn addition to the software, they offer consulting services like:\n(1) Coaching → Pre-IPO coaching & founder coaching\n(2) Strategy → Org Design, Leadership hiring etc\n(3) Hands-on → Growth engine design & implementation\n\n💡Very similar to McKinsey & its MBB peers, xto10x focuses on having small teams working deeply with large clients (200+ names including CRED, Groww, Razorpay, Meesho etc). Btw, many people don’t know that McKinsey also has a LOT of software which it sells to clients (topic for another post) - so the two firms are quite similar!\n\nWhat makes xto10x unique is that alongside consulting fees, it sometimes take an equity stake in companies it works with → per TRACXN, it has equity in ~35 companies (mostly at the Series B stage). HENCE, it has real skin in the game 💪\n\n➡️The goal ofis clear from the name itself → to help founders on the X to 10X journey. As their website says: “Scaling is hard. We make it easier.” This is an interesting n::1 business!\n\n…more\n537\n26 comments\n10 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nPeople Excellence Consultant\nPeople Excellence Consultant\nxto10x · Full-time\nxto10x · Full-time\nFeb 2023 -
