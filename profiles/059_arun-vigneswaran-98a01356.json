Variation across stages, disparate leveling structures, and a mix of cash, ESOPs, and PLI make designing a compelling rewards proposition without breaking the P&L quite complex. Last year, we stepped in to solve this by publishing benchmarks and insights on Cash and ESOPs for Product, Tech, and Design roles. This year, we've gone deeper! The expanded report now includes:\n\n▷ Founder and leadership cash & equity compensation\n▷ More job families such as Marketing, Finance, HR, Sales and more\n▷ Data from 6,000+ employees (3x growth from last year), with a higher mix of growth and late-stage companies\n\nIn addition to the compensation data-backed research, we have also spoken to ~100 founders and CHROs across different stages and leveraged our experience of working on this subject with 75+ startups over the last 6 years.\n\nHere are a few key insights:\n▷ Founder equity varies widely (0.8% to 74%) with absolutely no correlation to valuation.\n▷ MSOPs help mitigate dilution, with grants ranging from less than 1% to 6% of the company with different mechanics.\n▷ Leadership pay increases by 20-30% at each stage of startup growth.\n▷ Leaders in $5bn+ startups can make 4x their total cash earnings through ESOPs over their tenure (and up to 40x for highly critical leaders!).\n\nAccess the brief version of the report below for more such insights. We also have put together a comprehensive, full report that contains detailed pay ranges (25th to 90th percentile) on fixed and variable compensation for six job families—Marketing, Finance, Sales, Data Science, Engineering, and Design.\n\nDM for the details on access to the full version or in case you are looking for a debrief of the report. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts in the comments section.\n\n…more\nCompensation trends • 62 pages\n1/62\n111\n7 comments\n3 reposts\nArun Vigneswaran reposted this\nPeopleCues\nPeopleCues\n735 followers\n735 followers\n6mo • Edited • \n 6 months ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nDo you know the #1 reason employee feedback fails?\n\nIt’s NOT the surveys.\nIt’s NOT the data.\nIt’s the LACK of ACTION.\n\nIntroducing Action Planning on PeopleCues:\n\nEmpower managers: Gain AI-powered focus & actionable insights.\nBoost team engagement: See faster progress & increased engagement.\nDrive organizational results: Achieve measurable outcomes across the board.\n\nThe difference?
