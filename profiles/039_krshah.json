Not to talk about the buzz, but to help companies move from curiosity to real deployment.\n\nThat means understanding how GenAI can drive measurable impact across functions: product, engineering, sales, customer support, marketing, and more. It also means understanding what‚Äôs hype and what‚Äôs real.\n\nWe have kickstarted several projects that may significantly increase the pace of Gen AI adoption in the ecosystem. We‚Äôre looking to partner with mission aligned individuals: experts who‚Äôve helped companies deploy GenAI in live workflows or builders who have coached teams on the practical nuances of adopting Gen AI in the workplace.\n\nIf this sounds like you or someone you know, please DM me. We would love to learn from your experience and explore meaningful collaborations.\n‚Ä¶more\n64\n2 comments\n4 reposts\nKunal Shah\nKunal Shah\n ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\n3rd+\nxto10x Technologies | Urban Ladder | IIM Indore\nxto10x Technologies | Urban Ladder | IIM Indore\n2yr ‚Ä¢ \n 2 years ago ‚Ä¢ Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nxto10x\nxto10x\n21,217 followers\n21,217 followers\nAre you aspiring to become a future startup leader? \n\nandhave partnered to offer a free course that will make you startup-ready and provide a comprehensive understanding of the nuances and complexities involved in scaling a startup.\n\nJoin the course now:\n\nWhat's in store for you?\nüåü Exclusive interaction with, co-founder of&, upon course completion\nüìö Learn directly from the founders of top startups like,,, and\nüí° Learn cutting-edge scaling frameworks, developed based on our work with 300+ startups\n\nHere's an outline of the topics that will be covered by the mentors üëáüèª\n\n‚Ä¢ The DNA of a successful startup:()\n‚Ä¢ Strategy in startups:(,) and()\n‚Ä¢ Execution at scale:() and()\n‚Ä¢ Innovation in startups: Building scalable products by() and()\n‚Ä¢ Branding in startups:and() and()\n‚Ä¢ Building a startup that employees love:() and()\n‚Ä¢ Secrets for succeeding in a startup:(),() and()\n\nSpecial thanks to Professorfor providing us with the opportunity to host this first-of-a-kind program!\n\n‚Ä¶more\n5\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nServices @ xto10x technologies\nServices @ xto10x technologies\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nDec 2020 -
