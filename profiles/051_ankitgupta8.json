It was indeed a great pleasure to see all companies take away value and scaling roadmaps from the program.\n\nOn behalf of the entire team at, I’d like to extend heartfelt gratitude to their excellencies the governor and vice governors offor placing faith in us, andandfor their constant support and collaboration.\n\nA special mention to our partnersfor working hand in hand with us to achieve success in the program.\n\nAnd finally to entire team atthat worked hard behind the scenes with a single minded mission of creating value for all the scaling companies.\n\nWe look forward to creating many more success stories with you all!\n…more\n8\nAnkit Gupta reposted this\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\n   • 3rd+\nVerified • 3rd+\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\n3mo • \n 3 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nxto10x IPO Academy — standing on the shoulders of giants\n\nAs mentioned in my last post, we set out to create a program that would help venture-funded startups transform into high-performing public companies. But how could we do justice to such a complex topic?\n\nOur approach was to do extensive research with 25+ leaders who have experience of the public markets - from stalwarts to founders who’ve gone public recently. We would like to express our gratitude to a few who've gone above and beyond.\n\nhas a rare gift — ask a question, and he gives an answer that is a masterclass. We requested an hour of his time. He said, “Why only an hour? I’ll spend a full day. Bring all the founders you can.” He then talked us through the standards that can help startups become enduring public companies. That conversation led to an event where 80+ founders and CFOs signed a manifesto committing to build great listed companies — the perfect curtain-raiser for the Academy. Mohan’s passion for India is contagious.\n\n: For those who know Harsh, it won’t be a surprise that he had an almost ready-made playbook to build a board into a competitive advantage — refined over decades at Marico. Harsh introduced us to Hema Ravichandar (former NRC chair at Marico), who led a deeply practical discussion alongside Harsh on board management. Harsh spends serious time on preparation; in meetings, he listens carefully and answers every question; after, he always asks for feedback. Despite all he’s achieved, his simplicity and sincerity are remarkable.\n\nR Srinivasan: As CIO at SBI MF, Vasan plays a key role in India’s largest fund, but you’d never guess that from his humility and warmth. Within an hour of meeting, he busted several myths about public-market investors, and rattled off 10 books that inform his world view - from “Six Easy Pieces” by Feynman to “An Immense World” by Ed Yong. What does this have to do with investing? You’ll have to hear Vasan speak about the “Art and Science of Investing” to know the answer!\n\n(PB Fintech),(Ixigo),(Awfis): A program like this is incomplete without founders who have recently been through the IPO journey. If the other faculty are “professors”, then Alok, Aloke and Amit are “knowledgeable seniors” who deeply empathise with IPO-bound founders and have so much to share — how to prepare, what to do, and what to avoid. Their thoughtfulness, depth and genuine caring for other founders makes them special.\n\n,,,: One of our more fun events was with the JM Financial team - a quiz, valuation game and analyst coverage game - to help founders build a deeper appreciation for public markets. Everyone says i-bankers are focused only on the IPO event, but the JM team has shown their willingness to go above and beyond!\n\nIt takes a village… and we’ve had the blessings of the village “elders”. I look forward to sharing more next week!\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/8\nActivate to view larger image,\n298\n10 comments\n9 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nGrowth Leader\nGrowth Leader\nxto10x · Full-time\nxto10x · Full-time\nMay 2021 - Present · 4 yrs 3 mos\nMay 2021 to Present · 4 yrs 3 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nWorking with Startup founders on \n1.
