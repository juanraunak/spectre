I am passionate about solving such problems. \n\nMy role at xto10x focuses on working deeply with companies to align people priorities with business outcomes - taking the form of engagements varying from org design to leadership assessment & development to people systems design.\n\nOver the past few years, my interest in Applied Psychology deepened and led me to pursue training. Today, as a Professional Coach, I draw from the schools of Transactional Analysis and Psychodrama to help me work with founders, stakeholders and my teams. (Not to mention, in my personal sphere too!)\n\nOutside of work, I am known for my rather dry PJs and rather decent music skills. Having been a part of music bands since school, I became adept at playing the keys. Over the last few years, I have worked on my singing and occasionally perform for shows and record.\n…see more\nFeatured\nFeatured\nLink\nLink\nRahman Music Mash Up\nRahman Music Mash Up\nYouTube\nYouTube\nMusic is one of the things I am super happy to have brought back on track and actively made time for.

I personally never had the privilege of taking a company public as a founder, but as an active investor and advisor to many startups, I am so excited to see many founders preparing for an IPO. This is a fantastic opportunity for our ecosystem to build the next generation of technology-enabled, enduring businesses of the future. While I feel tremendously proud of this “coming-of-age” moment for the Indian startup ecosystem (we could see as many as 75 IPOs in the next 2-3 years!), it’s clear that many founders are still not fully prepared for the complexities in taking their companies public.\n\nIn the spirit of playing a relevant role in supporting this journey for the Indian startup ecosystem, we are launching the xto10x IPO Academy — a sincere attempt to make the IPO journey a little easier. The program brings together the best faculty (post-IPO founders, industry stalwarts, prominent board members, public market investors, i-bankers and more), powerful playbooks, and a small, tight-knit group of founders to support a company’s journey to IPO and beyond.\n\nYou can learn more about the academy here:\n\nIf you are a startup founder or CXO planning to IPO in the near future, please register for the curtain-raiser: “Setting Higher Standards to Build Enduring Public Companies,” by Mohandas Pai on 13th September.\n\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n1,658\n78 comments\n28 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nxto10x\nxto10x\nFull-time · 3 yrs 1 mo\nFull-time · 3 yrs 1 mo\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nHead - Leadership Development Practice\nHead - Leadership Development Practice\nJun 2023 - Present · 2 yrs 2 mos\nJun 2023 to Present · 2 yrs 2 mos\nMy work involves helping companies build, develop and sustain high quality leadership teams.\n\nThis manifests in different kinds of interventions - ranging from leadership assessments, development interventions like coaching and learning journeys, building trust between leadership team members etc.\n\nOur programs or interventions are designed around the business goals and context of the organization, and hence we focus on going deep in areas that will create impact.\n\nI personally enjoy facilitating as a process and hence, spend my time doing some of the workshops in addition to scaling the practice.\nOrganizational Design Practice\nOrganizational Design Practice\nJul 2022 - Present · 3 yrs 1 mo\nJul 2022 to Present · 3 yrs 1 mo\nI work with founders to set up their organizations for sustainable growth by evaluating their current org design against their strategy and figuring out what changes are needed across capabilities, structure, people and systems to best set them up for success.\n\nQuite often, this results in a need for founders to navigate change in the org with care. In such contexts, I also work with founders and leaders to help manage these transitions smoothly.\n\nWe work with clients across tech and non-tech sectors which are startups and mid-sized organizations\nVice President - Human Resources and Culture\nVice President - Human Resources and Culture\nDESIGN CAFE · Full-time\nDESIGN CAFE · Full-time\nMay 2019 - May 2022 · 3 yrs 1 mo\nMay 2019 to May 2022 · 3 yrs 1 mo\nGreater Bengaluru Area\nGreater Bengaluru Area\nLed the people mandate for a ~1000 member organization comprising a variety of talent - from tech to designers to factory workers.

This set in motion a multitude of cascading events that helped foster a high-performance culture across the organisation. \n\nI reported directly to Rahul for 3 years, a tenure during which I have seen Rahul encourage authenticity within the team and foster a strong sense of camaraderie, allowing the true potential of his democratic leadership style to drive change and impact. \nAs a Manager, he trusted me to drive high impact projects, ones I was truly passionate about, with as much creative flexibility and onus as he did with others - with the bigger picture in mind. This also helped set the right operating pace for the team, one that aligned with the organisation’s fast pace of growth. His ability to strategically manoeuvre complex challenges helped us navigate the transition from an early-phase to a high-growth startup, with a fortitude that I drew tremendous inspiration from. He encouraged the cultivation of a culture of humour at the workplace, one that impacted the build of stronger relationships and definitely made work fun while we were at it.\n\nI have had a lot to learn through this opportunity of working with Rahul and I couldn’t be more confident that it will be for any individual, team or organisation that he works with in the future.\nShow all 10 received\n\n\n\n\nCourses\nCourses\nB2B Marketing\nB2B Marketing\nAssociated with Indian Institute of Management, Indore\nAssociated with Indian Institute of Management, Indore\nBuilding Firm Capabilities\nBuilding Firm Capabilities\nAssociated with Indian Institute of Management, Indore\nAssociated with Indian Institute of Management, Indore\nShow all 8 courses\nLanguages\nLanguages\nEnglish\nEnglish\nFull professional proficiency\nFull professional proficiency\nHindi\nHindi\nProfessional working proficiency\nProfessional working proficiency\nShow all 3 languages\nInterests\nInterests\nTop Voices\nTop Voices\nCompanies\nCompanies\nGroups\nGroups\nNewsletters\nNewsletters\nSchools\nSchools\nNarendra Modi\nNarendra Modi\nPrime Minister of India\nPrime Minister of India\n4,842,489 followers\n4,842,489 followers\nFollow\nSimon Sinek\nSimon Sinek\nOptimist, New York Times bestselling author of \"Start with Why\" and \"The Infinite Game\", and founder of The Optimism Company\nOptimist, New York Times bestselling author of \"Start with Why\" and \"The Infinite Game\", and founder of The Optimism Company\n8,611,611 followers\n8,611,611 followers\nFollow\nShow all Top Voices\nMore profiles for you\nMore profiles for you\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies \nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\nConnect\nTanmay A.\nTanmay A.\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nProduct @ xto10x | Helping startups scale smarter\nProduct @ xto10x | Helping startups scale smarter\nConnect\nBinny Bansal\nBinny Bansal\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nCo-founder Flipkart, xto10x, Founder Opptra\nCo-founder Flipkart, xto10x, Founder Opptra\nConnect\nPawan Raghuveer\nPawan Raghuveer\nPawan Raghuveer\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nOperations Excellence at xto10x\nOperations Excellence at xto10x\nConnect\nSonali Jain\nSonali Jain\nSonali Jain\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nEmpowering AI startups @ Microsoft | ex -
