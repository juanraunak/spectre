I worked with AIESEC Navi Mumbai and sold internships to Non - Profits in Mumbai. I went on to work with several passionate people who'd dedicated their lives to uplifting others. It was here that I discovered I enjoy sales.\n\nI then went on to work with BucketBolt and ION Education - two startups in Mumbai - and successfully sold for them. It was here that I realized I was really good at selling.\n\nI decided I'd become a salesman. Super Salesman.\n\nSales excites me, and closing a deal gives me a certain rush and high. I'm able to sell so well, because I'm a very effective listener and have high empathy. This enables me to read between the lines and understand the true story - the motivations, the real reasons for rejection.\n\nThat's the reason I pursued an MBA. I wanted to put my skills to greater use.\n\nI have always been fascinated by selling and learning what makes one salesperson tick more than the other. I began my career as an Area Sales Manager with Becton Dickinson - a Fortune 300 firm.\nHere, I sold BD's premium solutions using a consultative approach to some of the top healthcare institutions.\nI am a Supersalesman with CureFit, an incredibly ambitious, almost crazy, startup in Bangalore. Here, I tell stories, and act as a Facilitator of change. I sell a healthy lifestyle.\n\nI aspire to be the best salesman around.\n…see more\nActivity\nActivity\n5,284 followers\n5,284 followers\nFollow\nPosts\nComments\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nSrinivaas Kartikk Takillapati reposted this\nNeeraj Aggarwal\nNeeraj Aggarwal\n   • 3rd+\nVerified • 3rd+\nCo-founder at xto10x | GM at Cure.fit | Vice President, Operations at Flipkart\nCo-founder at xto10x | GM at Cure.fit | Vice President, Operations at Flipkart\n7mo • Edited • \n 7 months ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\n2024 has been a very significant year for xto10x. In our core mission of helping companies scale more effectively, we’ve taken some very meaningful steps forward this year.\n\n- We worked with a total of 172 companies this year, with ~100 of them being first time engagements for xto10x. In total, since inception, xto10x has had the privilege of being a part of 545 companies’ scaling journeys. \n- Our footprint in Saudi Arabia continued to deepen across both start-ups and SMEs. This region now contributes to almost 25% of our revenue. \n- Our newest (and perhaps most ambitious) program, the IPO Academy was launched recently, with the objective of helping start-ups have a very successful IPO and post-IPO journey.\n- The number of employees using our HR SaaS tool, PeopleCues, for Engagement, OKRs and Performance, have almost doubled this year to 40,000.\n- We expanded our footprint in non-venture funded firms. From an iconic clothing brand, to a leading publishing house, to a jewellery manufacturer…. we’ve had amazing partnerships.\n\nSome of the most exciting problem statements we worked on this year included:\n\n- Growth & Marketing: Uncovering growth levers in ~15 D2C brands using our proprietary diagnostic toolkit, tripling organic traffic through a new brand campaign for an apparel brand, designing the inorganic playbook for doubling revenue for a B2B SaaS player...\n- Operations: Halving operating burn for a food delivery platform, improving delivery speeds for an online marketplace helping both conversion & retention, and re-thinking the network for a Q-com player to offer 5x more SKUs in a cost-neutral manner...\n- People Excellence: Re-designing Org Structure for companies, including unicorns, to de-bottleneck execution, re-structuring corporate costs to improve profitability, overhauling all people systems for an IPO bound company, programs to improve effectiveness of over 250 managers & leaders...\n- Planning & Governance: Strengthening AOP planning & metrics rigor at all levels for an agri-tech platform, installing & improving OKRs leading to stronger business planning in an ed-tech firm, creating execution momentum for new business lines in a unicorn...\n- Hiring: Staffing over 40 CXOs and leaders in more than 20 companies, allowing them the right leadership configuration needed.\n\nWe couldn’t be more excited about what the next year holds in store for us.\n\n…more\n489\n40 comments\n10 reposts\nSrinivaas Kartikk Takillapati\nSrinivaas Kartikk Takillapati\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nInvestor Partnerships, Content\nInvestor Partnerships, Content\n7mo • \n 7 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nCongrats to Gukesh!
