In my opinion, his ability to connect the dots & end to end thinking has been second to none. He's someone who is able to look beyond the obvious and unlock opportunities hitherto unknown. He is one of the most self-assured persons i've come across. And another thing that stands out in Tanveer is his selfless attitude & his willingness to support projects and initiatives beyond his usual domain. In addition to strong design thinking mindset, he packs a solid punch on the analytics front as well. eKart's supply chain network is powered by one of the extensive models built by Tanveer.
