I personally never had the privilege of taking a company public as a founder, but as an active investor and advisor to many startups, I am so excited to see many founders preparing for an IPO. This is a fantastic opportunity for our ecosystem to build the next generation of technology-enabled, enduring businesses of the future. While I feel tremendously proud of this ‚Äúcoming-of-age‚Äù moment for the Indian startup ecosystem (we could see as many as 75 IPOs in the next 2-3 years!), it‚Äôs clear that many founders are still not fully prepared for the complexities in taking their companies public.\n\nIn the spirit of playing a relevant role in supporting this journey for the Indian startup ecosystem, we are launching the xto10x IPO Academy ‚Äî a sincere attempt to make the IPO journey a little easier. The program brings together the best faculty (post-IPO founders, industry stalwarts, prominent board members, public market investors, i-bankers and more), powerful playbooks, and a small, tight-knit group of founders to support a company‚Äôs journey to IPO and beyond.\n\nYou can learn more about the academy here:\n\nIf you are a startup founder or CXO planning to IPO in the near future, please register for the curtain-raiser: ‚ÄúSetting Higher Standards to Build Enduring Public Companies,‚Äù by Mohandas Pai on 13th September.\n\n‚Ä¶more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n1,658\n78 comments\n28 reposts\nKhushbu Sen reposted this\nxto10x\nxto10x\n21,215 followers\n21,215 followers\n1yr ‚Ä¢ \n 1 year ago ‚Ä¢ Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nCelebrating 5 incredible years of serving the Indian startup ecosystem at xto10x!  üéâ\n\nThrowback to a day filled with laughter, camaraderie, and a celebration of five incredible years! ‚ú®\nFrom the buzzing energy at the office to the lively party that followed, our 5th-anniversary celebration was a testament to the amazing journey we've had together.\nCheers to the memories made, the challenges overcome, and the successes shared.\n\nHere's to many more years of scaling success for our ecosystem! üöÄüéä\n\n||\n\n‚Ä¶more\n178\n2 comments\n11 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nSenior Finance Specialist\nSenior Finance Specialist\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nJun 2023 - Present ¬∑ 2 yrs 2 mos\nJun 2023 to Present ¬∑ 2 yrs 2 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India ¬∑ Hybrid\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India ¬∑ Hybrid\n helped me get this job\nLinkedIn helped me get this job\nTibil Solutions\nTibil Solutions\nFull-time ¬∑ 5 yrs 9 mos\nFull-time ¬∑ 5 yrs 9 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India ¬∑ On-site\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India ¬∑ On-site\nSr. Account Executive\nSr. Account Executive\nOct 2020 - May 2023 ¬∑ 2 yrs 8 mos\nOct 2020 to May 2023 ¬∑ 2 yrs 8 mos\nTax Preparation, Accounting Standards and +21 skills\nJr. Account Executive\nJr. Account Executive\nSep 2017 - Sep 2020 ¬∑ 3 yrs 1 mo\nSep 2017 to Sep 2020 ¬∑ 3 yrs 1 mo\nAccounting Standards, Budgeting and +9 skills\nEducation\nEducation\nMohanlal Sukhadia University\nMohanlal Sukhadia University\nMaster of Commerce, Business\nMaster of Commerce, Business\nMar 2018\nMar 2018\nMohanlal Sukhadia University\nMohanlal Sukhadia University\nBachelor of Commerce \nBachelor of Commerce\nMar 2016\nMar 2016\nSkills\nSkills\nFinancial Operations\nFinancial Operations\nSr. Account Executive at Tibil Solutions\nSr. Account Executive at Tibil Solutions\n2 endorsements\n2 endorsements\nCash Flow Forecasting\nCash Flow Forecasting\nSr. Account Executive at Tibil Solutions\nSr. Account Executive at Tibil Solutions\n2 endorsements\n2 endorsements\nShow all 30 skills\nHonors & awards\nHonors & awards\nSpot Award\nSpot Award\nIssued by Tibil Solutions ¬∑ Feb 2022\nIssued by Tibil Solutions ¬∑ Feb 2022\nAssociated with Tibil Solutions\nAssociated with Tibil Solutions\nSpot Award - For the flexibility and good attitude of considering company before self.\nSpot Award - For the flexibility and good attitude of considering company before self.\nBest Performer in Business Unit - Support\nBest Performer in Business Unit - Support\nIssued by Tibil Solutions ¬∑ Feb 2019\nIssued by Tibil Solutions ¬∑ Feb 2019\nAssociated with Tibil Solutions\nAssociated with Tibil Solutions\nInterests\nInterests\nCompanies\nCompanies\nGroups\nGroups\nNewsletters\nNewsletters\nSchools\nSchools\nOracle\nOracle\n10,495,094 followers\n10,495,094 followers\nFollow\nAccenture\nAccenture\n13,538,403 followers\n13,538,403 followers\nFollow\nShow all companies\nMore profiles for you\nMore profiles for you\nCA Hari Prakash\nCA Hari Prakash\n¬∑ 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nxto10x || x- Ledger services Pvt Ltd ll x- Vasanth and Co.,|| CA (Dec 2021) ||\nFollow\nNikhil Tyagi\nNikhil Tyagi\n¬∑ 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nHelping companies in their journey to scale from x to 10x!
