Until now.\n\nAt Angel One, performance reviews that once took 4–6 weeks now wrap up in just 2–4, and that shift means everything. Huge thanks to Angel One team for the kind words, and for recognizing what we truly care about:\n📈 “You’ve moved the needle on the metrics that matter in a performance review.” –\n🤖 “The AI-led SBI feedback engine has completely changed the quality of feedback.” –\n\nIt’s a reminder that meaningful change at work doesn’t need to be loud, just well-designed.\nIf a better review experience helps employees feel heard and managers make sharper decisions, we’re doing our job right.\n\nWhat’s one underrated shift that’s made a big difference in your org?

Tests are just guesses.\n\nSo I’m flipping the model: Let the system tell me what I forgot to validate.\n\n⚙️ The pipeline I'm testing\n➕ Add @snoop to core infra modules\n📦 Capture logs from real or test runs\n\n🧠 Run a small Python script that:\nParses the trace\nReconstructs execution flow\nEmits test suggestions in Markdown or JSON\n🛠️ (Optional) Plug into CI to flag missed test coverage\n\n➡️ Runtime → Trace → Test\n\nEvery execution becomes a learning artifact.\n\n🌱 The long-term vision\n\n🤖 An AI observability agent that flags missing test cases live\n📈 A test suite that evolves with real traffic\n🔁 A tighter loop between dev, runtime, and QA\n💬 Want to jam on this over the weekend?\n\nIf you're into systems, tracing, test automation, or AI-for-engineering, let’s pair.\n\nJust enough time to sketch a working POC or shape it into a tiny OSS tool.\n\n…more\n17\n1 comment\n2 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nxto10x\nxto10x\nFull-time · 5 yrs 7 mos\nFull-time · 5 yrs 7 mos\nSenior Software Engineer\nSenior Software Engineer\nMar 2022 -
