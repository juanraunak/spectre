Generic recommendations. Brittle intelligence.\n\nCommerce 3.0 will need a new system of record for brands.\nEveryone tries to fix this by adding more apps.\nA \"smarter\" search bar, a new recommendations box.\nBut it's like putting a jet engine on a horse-drawn cart. We learned this the hard way. The real problem is the old PIM/PXM stack itself.\n\nSo we're starting over with a new approach: agents.\nInstead of software that supports a static store, what if the software is the store? A store that's alive. One that can rebuild parts of itself for every single visitor.\n\nHow?\nBy giving the store an AI workforce.\n\nThink of one agent as your photographer, generating new product shots on the fly. Another is your copywriter. A third is your merchandiser, constantly testing new layouts to see what works best for each person.\n\nThe goal is to solve the biggest headaches for brands.\nThat constant need for new photos and ads? The cost of that should go toward zero. And real 1-on-1 personalization is already possible with today’s AI.\n\nLook, we're just getting started. This is a huge idea and there's a lot to build.\nThis is Day 0, and we're convinced this is where commerce is going.\nThe tech is finally here to make it happen.\n\nWe're hiring a small, core team to build this new OS for brands.\nIf this sounds like the kind of problem you want to solve, you can read more about what we're doing here:\n…more\n185\n8 comments\n2 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nTalent Partner\nTalent Partner\nxto10x · Full-time\nxto10x · Full-time\nOct 2024 - Present · 10 mos\nOct 2024 to Present · 10 mos\nGurugram, Haryana, India · Hybrid\nGurugram, Haryana, India · Hybrid\nStrengthen the Leadership Hiring Practice with deeper client engagements and impacting in 10X results\nStrengthen the Leadership Hiring Practice with deeper client engagements and impacting in 10X results\nRIVR Partners\nRIVR Partners\n7 yrs 2 mos\n7 yrs 2 mos\nFounder\nFounder\nFull-time\nFull-time\nSep 2017 - Oct 2024 · 7 yrs 2 mos\nSep 2017 to Oct 2024 · 7 yrs 2 mos\nGreater Delhi Area · Hybrid\nGreater Delhi Area · Hybrid\nRishi brings about two decades of industry experience, being expert in executive search and\nhuman capital management. \n\nRIVR Partners is a 3-year-old Talent & Human Capital Advisory firm currently focusing on the\ninternet/tech ecosystem.
