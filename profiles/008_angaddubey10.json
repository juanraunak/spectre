We agreed that we are worse than animals, and you can see it everywhere.\nThere are problems only for humans created by humans, you can't find it in any other species.\n\nPoverty! Hunger! and the list goes on....\n‚Ä¶more\nAravind Unni\nAravind Unni\n   ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nVerified ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nUrban Practitioner, Researcher & Development Professional, New Delhi\nUrban Practitioner, Researcher & Development Professional, New Delhi\nhashtag\n#NeighbourhoodWalks\n\nMorning walks offer more than just health and calm‚Äîthey offer clarity. Streets that are chaotic by day reveal their truths in the quiet of early hours.\nWalking through my Delhi neighbourhood, I notice things. Some delightful, some frustrating.\n\nIn the last few months, I‚Äôve been seeing cars fitted with spike strips‚Äîmeant to keep dogs and cats from climbing or resting on them.\n\nLet that sink in. Cars parked on public roads, occupying most of the pavements, shaded space under trees - now come armed to keep animals away! And this isn‚Äôt new. We‚Äôve seen spikes under flyovers, on benches, at bus stops‚Äîmeant to prevent people, especially the homeless, from sitting or sleeping. So this then is just an adaptation - innovation for the worse.\n\nIt says a lot about who we are becoming‚Äîand a lot about our cities too. Places where exclusion is designed, and empathy is pushed out. Our cities, streets need to change. Not for accomodating parked steel boxes guzzling fossil fuels but for trees to give shade, people to sit, for children to walk to school, for dogs to rest and so on.\n\nWe need cities‚Äîand streets‚Äîthat are kind.\n‚Ä¶more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/3\nActivate to view larger image,\n3\nAngad Dubey\nAngad Dubey\n   ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nPremium ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nEnigneering at Microsoft | ex- xto10x, Tata Steel | CSE, NIT Jamshedpur | Navodayan\nEnigneering at Microsoft | ex- xto10x, Tata Steel | CSE, NIT Jamshedpur | Navodayan\nView my services\n2mo ‚Ä¢ \n 2 months ago ‚Ä¢ Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nCEASEFIRE !! üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥\n4\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nSoftware Engineer\nSoftware Engineer\nMicrosoft ¬∑ Full-time\nMicrosoft ¬∑ Full-time\nAug 2022 - Present ¬∑ 3 yrs\nAug 2022 to Present ¬∑ 3 yrs\nHyderabad, Telangana, India\nHyderabad, Telangana, India\nSoftware Engineer\nSoftware Engineer\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nNov 2021 - Jul 2022 ¬∑ 9 mos\nNov 2021 to Jul 2022 ¬∑ 9 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nSoftware Engineer\nSoftware Engineer\nTata Steel ¬∑ Full-time\nTata Steel ¬∑ Full-time\nJul 2019 - Oct 2021 ¬∑ 2 yrs 4 mos\nJul 2019 to Oct 2021 ¬∑ 2 yrs 4 mos\nJamshedpur, Jharkhand, India\nJamshedpur, Jharkhand, India\n‚Ä¢Planning & Scheduling\n Worked on enhancements in APIs and error resolution for Planning & Scheduling Module of CRM-MES which includes Coil Linking, Coil De-Linking, Order Progress, Inventory Management, etc.\n\n‚Ä¢Logistics\nCreated REST APIs and Oracle procedures for Extra to Order(ETO) , Planning Hold, Dispatch Reporting & Daily Production.\n\n‚Ä¢Data Exchange b/w Systems\nImplemented data sharing of CRM-MES with Level 2 automation for PLTCM and CAL, Lab Management System, Order Management System for communication between these systems with CRM- MES.\n\n‚Ä¢Quality Assessment(QA)\nDeveloped QA Module of CRM-MES which includes Sample & Test Result Management , Quality Decision, Coil Hold, Lab Report, Batch Defect Management, Quality Summary & Coil Card which handles different functions of QA.\n\n‚Ä¢System Design(Low Level)\nDeveloped the application architecture, master page and common modules for database access, error logging, excel processing, common popups, etc. for IT system to manage operations of CRM of TSK Plant.\n\n‚Ä¢MES Auditing\nDeveloped triggers and procedures for auditing changes of over 25+ tables which processes critical business data of CRM-MES for TSK Plant.\n\n‚Ä¢Reporting System\nDesigned, developed & deployed of reporting system to digitize and automate the daily reporting system of HSM(Hot Strip Mill) Yard(3MTPA).
