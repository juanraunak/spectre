This sparkly suit is fun but definitely no me üòÇ\n\n\nThe second one: V sweater with folded sleeves, A brown belt with beige trousers. I liked seeing it.\n\n\nHonestly, I would have never tried this. I am a dark denims, black belts & solid colored T-Shirts kinda guy\n\n\nFor someone who sees colors differently & finds shopping a chore, GlanceAI offered a genuine Aha.\n\n\nWe are launching this on *Thursday, May 22nd* An effortless style discovery, regardless of your visual perception for fashion. Works for colorblinds too :)\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/2\nActivate to view larger image,\n205\n16 comments\nAbhishek Deshmukh\nAbhishek Deshmukh\n   ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nPremium ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nVice President Corporate Strategy at InMobi Group\nVice President Corporate Strategy at InMobi Group\n1yr ‚Ä¢ \n 1 year ago ‚Ä¢ Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nI‚Äôm happy to share that I‚Äôm starting a new position as Vice President Corporate Strategy at InMobi Advertising!\nStarting a New Position\n402\n65 comments\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nVice President Corporate Strategy\nVice President Corporate Strategy\nInMobi ¬∑ Full-time\nInMobi ¬∑ Full-time\nApr 2024 -
