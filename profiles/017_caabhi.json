In our core mission of helping companies scale more effectively, we‚Äôve taken some very meaningful steps forward this year.\n\n- We worked with a total of 172 companies this year, with ~100 of them being first time engagements for xto10x. In total, since inception, xto10x has had the privilege of being a part of 545 companies‚Äô scaling journeys.\n- Our footprint in Saudi Arabia continued to deepen across both start-ups and SMEs. This region now contributes to almost 25% of our revenue.\n- Our newest (and perhaps most ambitious) program, the IPO Academy was launched recently, with the objective of helping start-ups have a very successful IPO and post-IPO journey.\n- The number of employees using our HR SaaS tool, PeopleCues, for Engagement, OKRs and Performance, have almost doubled this year to 40,000.\n- We expanded our footprint in non-venture funded firms. From an iconic clothing brand, to a leading publishing house, to a jewellery manufacturer‚Ä¶. we‚Äôve had amazing partnerships.\n\nSome of the most exciting problem statements we worked on this year included:\n\n- Growth & Marketing: Uncovering growth levers in ~15 D2C brands using our proprietary diagnostic toolkit, tripling organic traffic through a new brand campaign for an apparel brand, designing the inorganic playbook for doubling revenue for a B2B SaaS player...\n- Operations: Halving operating burn for a food delivery platform, improving delivery speeds for an online marketplace helping both conversion & retention, and re-thinking the network for a Q-com player to offer 5x more SKUs in a cost-neutral manner...\n- People Excellence: Re-designing Org Structure for companies, including unicorns, to de-bottleneck execution, re-structuring corporate costs to improve profitability, overhauling all people systems for an IPO bound company, programs to improve effectiveness of over 250 managers & leaders...\n- Planning & Governance: Strengthening AOP planning & metrics rigor at all levels for an agri-tech platform, installing & improving OKRs leading to stronger business planning in an ed-tech firm, creating execution momentum for new business lines in a unicorn...\n- Hiring: Staffing over 40 CXOs and leaders in more than 20 companies, allowing them the right leadership configuration needed.\n\nWe couldn‚Äôt be more excited about what the next year holds in store for us.\n\n‚Ä¶more\n7\nAbhishek Kumar reposted this\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\n   ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nVerified ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\n10mo ‚Ä¢ \n 10 months ago ‚Ä¢ Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nBuilding great public market companies - IPO readiness\n\nOn Friday, we had a wonderful curtain-raiser session for theIPO academy with. Mohan had everyone spellbound for 2.5 hours (no breaks and no one moved!) - sharing the deep learnings from his years as Infosys CFO - on what it means to be truly ready to be a public company. Not just doing the IPO transaction, but being ready for the years of consistent growth and value creation that must come hand-in-hand with the responsibility of taking money from retail shareholders.\n\nThe reality is, many of us in the startup ecosystem are at the risk of missing these six simple truths (\"readiness conditions\") in our preparation to go public:\n1. A unique ‚Äúdisruptor‚Äù business model that can outperform peers - with strong visibility into the first 8 quarters of growth/profit performance post-IPO\n2. Ability to give accurate guidance and consistently deliver\n3. An IPO-ready team that can scale with the business\n4. An independent, highly-skilled board - as a competitive advantage\n5. High transparency & 100% compliance\n6. A price that leaves value on the table, ensuring great returns for both new and existing shareholders\n\nAfter Mohan's talk, we did a readiness assessment with the audience of founders/CFOs on where they felt they stood on these six areas. The result was quite revealing (see attached graphic) - with board readiness coming out as the lowest scoring area. One surprise in the self-assessment for me was that consistent quarter-to-quarter performance came out quite high on the readiness score - we know from our work atthat this is something that worries many founders headed to IPO in the next 2-3 years.\n\nThe high point of the session was the manifesto signing where 80+ founders/CFOs (inspired by Mohan's words!) signed a simple statement committing to work towards true readiness before going public. We wrote this manifesto after more than 25 conversations with founders, industry stalwarts, board members, investment bankers, regulators and functional leaders who have gone public - as a simple mission statement of what we should work towards as the startup ecosystem. We will do our best asto provide operating support and act as conscience-keepers to help achieve this goal.\n\nTo read the full manifesto, please feel free to download it from(don't worry, it's not behind a paywall or registration form!). If you have IPO on your mind (who doesn't!!) and would like to discuss some of these readiness areas, please feel free to drop me a line at.\n\n‚Ä¶more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/5\nActivate to view larger image,\n328\n8 comments\n15 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nHead of Finance\nHead of Finance\nxto10x\nxto10x\nJun 2023 - Present ¬∑ 2 yrs 2 mos\nJun 2023 to Present ¬∑ 2 yrs 2 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nFinancial Controller\nFinancial Controller\nZebPay\nZebPay\nJan 2022 - May 2023 ¬∑ 1 yr 5 mos\nJan 2022 to May 2023 ¬∑ 1 yr 5 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nAsst.
