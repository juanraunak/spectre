Mohan had everyone spellbound for 2.5 hours (no breaks and no one moved!) - sharing the deep learnings from his years as Infosys CFO - on what it means to be truly ready to be a public company. Not just doing the IPO transaction, but being ready for the years of consistent growth and value creation that must come hand-in-hand with the responsibility of taking money from retail shareholders.\n\nThe reality is, many of us in the startup ecosystem are at the risk of missing these six simple truths (\"readiness conditions\") in our preparation to go public:\n1. A unique “disruptor” business model that can outperform peers - with strong visibility into the first 8 quarters of growth/profit performance post-IPO\n2. Ability to give accurate guidance and consistently deliver\n3. An IPO-ready team that can scale with the business\n4. An independent, highly-skilled board - as a competitive advantage\n5. High transparency & 100% compliance\n6. A price that leaves value on the table, ensuring great returns for both new and existing shareholders\n\nAfter Mohan's talk, we did a readiness assessment with the audience of founders/CFOs on where they felt they stood on these six areas. The result was quite revealing (see attached graphic) - with board readiness coming out as the lowest scoring area. One surprise in the self-assessment for me was that consistent quarter-to-quarter performance came out quite high on the readiness score - we know from our work atthat this is something that worries many founders headed to IPO in the next 2-3 years.\n\nThe high point of the session was the manifesto signing where 80+ founders/CFOs (inspired by Mohan's words!) signed a simple statement committing to work towards true readiness before going public. We wrote this manifesto after more than 25 conversations with founders, industry stalwarts, board members, investment bankers, regulators and functional leaders who have gone public - as a simple mission statement of what we should work towards as the startup ecosystem. We will do our best asto provide operating support and act as conscience-keepers to help achieve this goal.\n\nTo read the full manifesto, please feel free to download it from(don't worry, it's not behind a paywall or registration form!). If you have IPO on your mind (who doesn't!!) and would like to discuss some of these readiness areas, please feel free to drop me a line at.\n\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/5\nActivate to view larger image,\n328\n8 comments\n15 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nServices\nServices\nxto10x · Full-time\nxto10x · Full-time\nAug 2022 - Present · 3 yrs\nAug 2022 to Present · 3 yrs\nPartnering with startups to help them scale meaningfully.\nPartnering with startups to help them scale meaningfully.\nEntrepreneurship and Strategic Planning\nPaytm\nPaytm\nFull-time · 1 yr 10 mos\nFull-time · 1 yr 10 mos\nSenior Manager\nSenior Manager\nAug 2021 - Aug 2022 · 1 yr 1 mo\nAug 2021 to Aug 2022 · 1 yr 1 mo\n• Developed post sales merchant engagement model to drive continuous growth in GMV and other key business parameters\n• Led business analytics to understand post buying behavior of ~3 lac merchants and create cohorts for sharper targeting\nStrategic Planning\nExecutive Manager\nExecutive Manager\nNov 2020 - Jul 2021 · 9 mos\nNov 2020 to Jul 2021 · 9 mos\nNoida, Uttar Pradesh, India\nNoida, Uttar Pradesh, India\nEstablished a new business unit for offline payments business\n• Coordinated with tech team to create a DIY purchase flow and non-tech team to set up E2E sales & operations processes\n• Led business growth via lead generation campaigns on various channels\nEntrepreneurship and Strategic Planning\nConsultant\nConsultant\nDeloitte India · Full-time\nDeloitte India · Full-time\nJun 2018 - Nov 2020 · 2 yrs 6 mos\nJun 2018 to Nov 2020 · 2 yrs 6 mos\nMumbai Metropolitan Region\nMumbai Metropolitan Region\nSelect project experience:\n\nPost-Merger Integration support for a global FMCG giant acquiring the consumer health business of a pharmaceutical company\n• Smooth migration of 2000+ employees, across 10 geographies, by deploying high-touch support model\n• Identified day 1 risks related to data and helped resolve the risks through effective mitigation mechanism\n\nDigital transformation of material forecasting to assure gross margin projections for a global FMCG business leader\n• Engaged with 100+ buyers to analyse the highly varied material forecasting process across 30+ countries, involving completely different portfolios & forecasting methodologies to identify standardization opportunities\n• Digitization of the extensive manual process using automation tools such as Anaplan, ML/Data science models with Data Lake as back bone\n• Fundamental impact through approx. 20% improvement in forecasting accuracy, 70% reduction in effort and 50% reduction in cycle time through automation of the entire packaging portfolio with an approx. value > €9 billion\n\nStrategy design & detailed business model evaluation to outsource township management services for a large PSU steel manufacturer\n• Assessed the as-is condition of infrastructure and identified potential improvement areas by conducting an exhaustive study of processes and systems in place across the 5 townships locations\n• Comprehensive analysis (equity participation, shareholding, revenue streams, PSU’s role) of the two identified business models i.e. Total Facility Management and Joint Venture, along with financial projections\n• Single-handedly developed the power distribution outsourcing;
