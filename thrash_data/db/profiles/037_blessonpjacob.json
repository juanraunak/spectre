The magic? It wasn‚Äôt just about learning‚Äîit was about collective problem-solving seeded by‚Äòs tested frameworks, real-life case studies, and rich founder experiences. Every question sparked insights. Every challenge turned into a shared opportunity for growth.\n\nWe deep-dived into logistics and warehouse costs and levers to control them, the true impact of delivery speed and accurate promise on profitability, the constant trade-off between cost efficiency and customer delight, and in the process we busted myths like ‚Äúfaster = costlier‚Äù\n\nThe outcome? Actionable takeaways, new ways of thinking, and a community of founders helping each other win.\n\nCheck out the highlights to see these powerful conversations in action.\n\nBig thanks to all the founders who made these sessions truly special with their openness and insight.\n\nGagandeep M.\n\n‚Ä¶more\n133\n1 comment\n9 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nHuman Resources Consultant\nHuman Resources Consultant\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nOct 2021 -
