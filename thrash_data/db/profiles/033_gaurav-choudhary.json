And, on 9th Feb ‘22, Binny topped the company up with $25M in funding (from his own pocket). We don’t have latest data on company performance, since it is SG domiciled, but FY23 was ~$14M in revenue & profitable.\n\nxto10x combines the traditional ‘McKinsey model’ i.e. consulting (70% of revenue) with a ‘builders approach’ i.e. product / software led engagements (30% of revenue)\n\n“PeopleCues” is their software platform, priced at ~$8 per seat per month, which comprises\n\n(a) OKR management\n(b) Performance management\n(c) Culture & Employee NPS (eNPS)\n\nIn addition to the software, they offer consulting services like:\n(1) Coaching → Pre-IPO coaching & founder coaching\n(2) Strategy → Org Design, Leadership hiring etc\n(3) Hands-on → Growth engine design & implementation\n\n💡Very similar to McKinsey & its MBB peers, xto10x focuses on having small teams working deeply with large clients (200+ names including CRED, Groww, Razorpay, Meesho etc). Btw, many people don’t know that McKinsey also has a LOT of software which it sells to clients (topic for another post) - so the two firms are quite similar!\n\nWhat makes xto10x unique is that alongside consulting fees, it sometimes take an equity stake in companies it works with → per TRACXN, it has equity in ~35 companies (mostly at the Series B stage). HENCE, it has real skin in the game 💪\n\n➡️The goal ofis clear from the name itself → to help founders on the X to 10X journey. As their website says: “Scaling is hard. We make it easier.” This is an interesting n::1 business!\n\n…more\n537\n26 comments\n10 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nxto10x\nxto10x\nFull-time · 6 yrs 4 mos\nFull-time · 6 yrs 4 mos\nProduct Leader\nProduct Leader\nJan 2023 - Present · 2 yrs 7 mos\nJan 2023 to Present · 2 yrs 7 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · On-site\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · On-site\nProduct Management and Machine Learning\nSenior Product Manager\nSenior Product Manager\nJun 2021 - Jan 2023 · 1 yr 8 mos\nJun 2021 to Jan 2023 · 1 yr 8 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nProduct Management and Machine Learning\nProduct Manager\nProduct Manager\nApr 2019 - Jun 2021 · 2 yrs 3 mos\nApr 2019 to Jun 2021 · 2 yrs 3 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nProduct Management and Machine Learning\nSenior Analyst - Business Insights\nSenior Analyst - Business Insights\nMyntra\nMyntra\nJun 2018 - Mar 2019 · 10 mos\nJun 2018 to Mar 2019 · 10 mos\nBangaon, West Bengal, India\nBangaon, West Bengal, India\nMachine Learning\nAssociate Product Manager\nAssociate Product Manager\nOla (ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd)\nOla (ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd)\nJul 2016 - Jun 2018 · 2 yrs\nJul 2016 to Jun 2018 · 2 yrs\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nProduct Management and Machine Learning\nSummer Intern\nSummer Intern\nAdoro\nAdoro\nMay 2015 - Jul 2015 · 3 mos\nMay 2015 to Jul 2015 · 3 mos\nMumbai Metropolitan Region\nMumbai Metropolitan Region\nAdoro is a fashion-focused social-network for women to discover & shop products and trends that are liked, curated, updated real-time from across the web.\n\nThe project involved \"Optimization of personalized user recommendation engine\".
