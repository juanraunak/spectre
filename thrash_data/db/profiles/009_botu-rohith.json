Currently, I'm working at Flipkart, as a supply planning intern . As the CTO of the Inspired Karters Gravity team, I've honed my leadership and engineering skills while designing a human-powered rover for NASA's HERC event. Committed to personal growth and teamwork, I'm poised to excel in roles spanning Supply Chain, Mechanical Design, Product Management, or Business Analysis. As graduation approaches, I'm eager to transition into a full-time role, leveraging my unique skill set and dedication to drive success in these fields\n…see more\nActivity\nActivity\n5,142 followers\n5,142 followers\nPosts\nComments\nLoaded 5 Posts posts\nRohith Botu reposted this\nBhanu Pathak\nBhanu Pathak\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nCXO | Consumer-Tech & Marketplace Leader | xto10x | Tata Neu | Founding Team @ Udaan | Flipkart | P&G | J&J\nCXO | Consumer-Tech & Marketplace Leader | xto10x | Tata Neu | Founding Team @ Udaan | Flipkart | P&G | J&J\n1mo • Edited • \n 1 month ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nIn recent months, we at xto10x have been speaking with founders and experts to develop a definitive point of view on GenAI applications in startups. Not to talk about the buzz, but to help companies move from curiosity to real deployment.\n\nThat means understanding how GenAI can drive measurable impact across functions: product, engineering, sales, customer support, marketing, and more. It also means understanding what’s hype and what’s real.\n\nWe have kickstarted several projects that may significantly increase the pace of Gen AI adoption in the ecosystem. We’re looking to partner with mission aligned individuals: experts who’ve helped companies deploy GenAI in live workflows or builders who have coached teams on the practical nuances of adopting Gen AI in the workplace.\n\nIf this sounds like you or someone you know, please DM me. We would love to learn from your experience and explore meaningful collaborations.\n…more\n64\n2 comments\n4 reposts\nRohith Botu reposted this\nPawan Raghuveer\nPawan Raghuveer\nPawan Raghuveer\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nOperations Excellence at xto10x\nOperations Excellence at xto10x\n1mo • \n 1 month ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nEver wondered how to unlock 5–7% CM1 in a D2C business through operations excellence?\n\nThat’s exactly what we set out to explore in our founders-only roundtables this April and May.\n\nThese sessions brought together sharp, curious, and candid founders. The magic? It wasn’t just about learning—it was about collective problem-solving seeded by‘s tested frameworks, real-life case studies, and rich founder experiences. Every question sparked insights. Every challenge turned into a shared opportunity for growth.\n\nWe deep-dived into logistics and warehouse costs and levers to control them, the true impact of delivery speed and accurate promise on profitability, the constant trade-off between cost efficiency and customer delight, and in the process we busted myths like “faster = costlier”\n\nThe outcome? Actionable takeaways, new ways of thinking, and a community of founders helping each other win.\n\nCheck out the highlights to see these powerful conversations in action.\n\nBig thanks to all the founders who made these sessions truly special with their openness and insight.\n\nGagandeep M.\n\n…more\n133\n1 comment\n9 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nOperations Partner\nOperations Partner\nxto10x · Full-time\nxto10x · Full-time\nOct 2024 - Present · 10 mos\nOct 2024 to Present · 10 mos\nMumbai, Maharashtra, India · On-site\nMumbai, Maharashtra, India · On-site\nSupply Planning Analyst\nSupply Planning Analyst\nFlipkart · Internship\nFlipkart · Internship\nJul 2023 - Dec 2023 · 6 mos\nJul 2023 to Dec 2023 · 6 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · On-site\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · On-site\n• Implemented a shift from unit-based to shipment-based capacity utilization, integrating a visibility tracker.
