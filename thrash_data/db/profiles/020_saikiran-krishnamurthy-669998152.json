By the time it listed, it delivered consistent progress on all key metrics (# of centers, ROCE, utilization etc.).\n\nIxigo filed their DRHP in 2021 and conducted roadshows, but ultimately delayed their IPO due to macro headwinds. Aloke shared why this was a blessing in disguise - it established a baseline for investors, helped refine the narrative based on roadshow feedback, and got Ixigo to start behaving like a public company (strong IDs, AOP discipline, etc.). Their listing in 2024 went smoothly as a result.\n\nAlok, who was the CFO during PB’s listing, broke down the readiness journey into a 50+ point checklist: covering everything founders need to do from 2Y pre-listing to post-IPO, going as far as sharing contacts of key individuals (lawyers, bankers, consultants) who can help in various steps.\n\nWhat stood out was they disagreed a lot! Whether to hire agencies for IR. How to work with auditors. The role of domestic & international lawyers. These sparked lively debates among faculty and participants alike. And that was the magic of the session: it wasn’t about the one right answer - but about the range of paths to readiness and the trade-offs involved in each.\n\nDespite the differences, the end-state for readiness was strikingly similar:\n1. A differentiated business model with superior operating performance to peers\n2. Consistency in performance via strong input-output equations for P&L drivers\n3. A simple narrative that captures the uniqueness\n4. Transparency on the \"beating heart\" metrics\n5. A price that attracts the right investors\n\nThese themes also appear consistently in the one-on-one work we do with companies headed to IPO. Some recurring observations:\n\n- Founders often take their uniqueness for granted and don't do justice to it in their narrative. For example, one company built a narrative around its product & customers. These are good, but the real differentiator was its proven acquisition engine. This simple shift in framing changed how they track input metrics and allocate resources.\n- The “beating heart” metrics are often not linked with financial performance. For example, a company had great retention and organic growth but this did not translate into high EBITDA or cash flow growth. An investigation into the “why” revealed the importance of cost focus and operating leverage.\n\nComing soon: Org readiness!\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/3\nActivate to view larger image,\n81\n1 comment\n5 reposts\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\n   • 3rd+\nVerified • 3rd+\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\n2mo • \n 2 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nIt was our privilege to host you Vipul Shinghal - thanks so much for joining us and sharing your leadership lessons from a lifetime of service in the Indian Army - three lessons in particular stayed with me:\n\n1.
