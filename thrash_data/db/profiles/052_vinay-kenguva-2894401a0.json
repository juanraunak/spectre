Thanks for stopping by!\n\nA small-town dreamer turned software developer, graduating from a premier institute, but that’s just the résumé. Here’s the real deal:\n\n✨ Thinker & Doer – Thrive on deep discussions, solving puzzles, and chasing what excites me.\n✨ Comfort > Glamour – Happiness in simplicity, growth in curiosity, and resilience in every outcome.\n✨ Mentor at Heart – Love guiding juniors. No ghosting—promise! 😊\n✨ Always Evolving – On a journey of fitness, cooking, mindfulness, and self-discovery—because life’s too short for monotony.\n\nBangalore? Let’s connect over coffee (or chai!) and swap stories, ideas, or just good vibes.\n…see more\nFeatured\nFeatured\nPost\nPost\n𝐇𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐈 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐞 𝐣𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐚𝐬 𝐒𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫 🎉 \n\n𝐀 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐝 𝐔𝐧𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧… 💔\n\nI was fortunate enough to get an opportunity to interview at Google, a company I had admired for years.\n📌 Screening Round: Cleared! ✅\n📌 DSA Interviews: Three intense rounds, successfully cracked them all.\n📌 Hiring Manager Round: Cleared with positive feedback.\n\nThen came the HR call—the one I had been waiting for. My heart was racing, expecting an offer. Instead, I was told the team had decided not to move forward with my application. No specific reason, no feedback—just an abrupt end to what had felt like a promising journey.\n\nI reached out to HR, hoping for at least some closure, but my emails went unanswered. After months of effort, it was tough to process—not just the rejection, but the lack of clarity after making it through so many rounds.\n\nIt hurt. Not because I didn’t make it, but because after investing so much time and energy, I was left with unanswered questions, definitely not something i was expecting from a company like Google.\n\nPS : Will be sharing my detailed interview experience in my next post.\n\n267\n5 comments\nPost\nPost\nYugabyte (60𝐋 𝐂𝐓𝐂 : 20𝐋 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞, 85𝐤 𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝) 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞.\n\n𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐞: SDET internship\n\n𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠:\nOffcampus, Reached out to a hr informing my interest toward working at their organization.\n\n𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 1: 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭\n4 DSA questions(3 medium, 1 hard)\nTried compiling a few questions in the following link.\n\nSolved 3 out of 4\n\n𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 2: 𝐃𝐒𝐀 + 𝐂𝐬𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬\nRobot-bounded-inc-circle:\nA question based on array + map + prefix_sum.\nNormalisation it's advantage and disadvantage.\n\n𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 3 : 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐦𝐚𝐳𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.\nHandling possible failure cases\n-> subscriber moving to a different country\n-> failure from bank end during subscription\n-> updation/modification of plans etc\nSuggestion :\nGo with open mind\nNeed of general awareness and knowledge over product working\nAbility to look and handling corner cases\n\nVerdict : Selected :)\n\nPS : Do checkout my prev posts for other interview experiences, and remaining on the way.\n\n589\n9 comments\nPost\nPost\n𝐉𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐚 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐞𝐫.\n\nElated to present the list of companies that have extended job offers to me\n,,,,,,\n\nThroughout this journey, I've come to realise that while possessing valuable skills and knowledge is important, the network I've cultivated over time has proven to be just as crucial in unlocking these opportunities.\n\nI'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude for the following who provide enriching content free of charge in youtube and other platforms, contributing in my journey of success.\n,,,,,,,,,...and many more\n\nA special shout-out goes to my friend, the coding platform, and the professional networkfor playing pivotal roles in guiding me towards the path of success.\n\nNavigating job opportunities might seem daunting, especially now.
