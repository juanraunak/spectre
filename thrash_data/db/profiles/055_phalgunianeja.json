Every single day. Because this isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust politics.‚Äù It‚Äôs not a sidebar to the rest of life. It is life. And it is death. And it is funded by our taxes.\n\nThis is personal. It‚Äôs also deeply professional.\n\nBecause if your work is part of an industry that prides itself on being future-facing, empathetic, creative, or \"people-first\", then you don‚Äôt get to post ‚Äúhuman-centred design‚Äù slides in the morning and scroll past dead and starving babies in the afternoon. The cognitive dissonance should be unbearable. And if it isn‚Äôt, then that‚Äôs the real issue here.\n\nWe‚Äôve made a habit of compartmentalising. Taught to split ourselves: human over here, professional over there. Keep your outrage out of your deck. Keep your grief out of the Slack channel. Keep your conscience out of your keynote.\n\nBut the boundary was always a lie. A convenient fiction that allows industries to profit while staying apolitical. That lets people keep scrolling. That turns atrocity into abstraction.\n\nOver 15,000 children have been killed. This isn‚Äôt a political debate. It‚Äôs a moral collapse. It‚Äôs a G-E-N-O-C-I-D-E. Say it with me - clearly, fully, without flinching.\n\nSo no, I‚Äôm not interested in your new ‚ÄúChatGPT cheat codes.‚Äù Or your hottest Gen Z trend report. Not because those things don‚Äôt matter. But because they don‚Äôt matter more.\n\nIf we can‚Äôt bring our full selves - grief, anger, accountability included - into our so-called professional spaces, then what exactly are we building?\n\nBecause whatever it is, it isn‚Äôt a better future.\n\n------------\n\nSide note - I see you, agency leaders and strategy heavyweights, checking out my LI profile after I share posts like this - where are your voices? where are your values? It's always the same old shit with you, all talk and no trousers. Cowards.\n‚Ä¶more\n174\n16 comments\n14 reposts\nPhalguni Aneja\nPhalguni Aneja\n   ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nVerified ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nBrand & Innovation Leader | FMCG, D2C & Consumer Tech | 12Y experience - ITC, J&J, cult.fit, Wakefit | Social Samosa 40u40\nBrand & Innovation Leader | FMCG, D2C & Consumer Tech | 12Y experience - ITC, J&J, cult.fit, Wakefit | Social Samosa 40u40\n2mo ‚Ä¢ \n 2 months ago ‚Ä¢ Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nLooking for Bangalore based boutique agencies to manage community, content creation and posting and small scale performance for a new brand in the fitness space.
