A clear win for efficiency and employee experience!\n‚Ä¶more\nPeopleCues\nPeopleCues\n735 followers\n735 followers\n6-week review cycles were the norm. Until now.\n\nAt Angel One, performance reviews that once took 4‚Äì6 weeks now wrap up in just 2‚Äì4, and that shift means everything. Huge thanks to Angel One team for the kind words, and for recognizing what we truly care about:\nüìà ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve moved the needle on the metrics that matter in a performance review.‚Äù ‚Äì\nü§ñ ‚ÄúThe AI-led SBI feedback engine has completely changed the quality of feedback.‚Äù ‚Äì\n\nIt‚Äôs a reminder that meaningful change at work doesn‚Äôt need to be loud, just well-designed.\nIf a better review experience helps employees feel heard and managers make sharper decisions, we‚Äôre doing our job right.\n\nWhat‚Äôs one underrated shift that‚Äôs made a big difference in your org?

And, on 9th Feb ‚Äò22, Binny topped the company up with $25M in funding (from his own pocket). We don‚Äôt have latest data on company performance, since it is SG domiciled, but FY23 was ~$14M in revenue & profitable.\n\nxto10x combines the traditional ‚ÄòMcKinsey model‚Äô i.e. consulting (70% of revenue) with a ‚Äòbuilders approach‚Äô i.e. product / software led engagements (30% of revenue)\n\n‚ÄúPeopleCues‚Äù is their software platform, priced at ~$8 per seat per month, which comprises\n\n(a) OKR management\n(b) Performance management\n(c) Culture & Employee NPS (eNPS)\n\nIn addition to the software, they offer consulting services like:\n(1) Coaching ‚Üí Pre-IPO coaching & founder coaching\n(2) Strategy ‚Üí Org Design, Leadership hiring etc\n(3) Hands-on ‚Üí Growth engine design & implementation\n\nüí°Very similar to McKinsey & its MBB peers, xto10x focuses on having small teams working deeply with large clients (200+ names including CRED, Groww, Razorpay, Meesho etc). Btw, many people don‚Äôt know that McKinsey also has a LOT of software which it sells to clients (topic for another post) - so the two firms are quite similar!\n\nWhat makes xto10x unique is that alongside consulting fees, it sometimes take an equity stake in companies it works with ‚Üí per TRACXN, it has equity in ~35 companies (mostly at the Series B stage). HENCE, it has real skin in the game üí™\n\n‚û°Ô∏èThe goal ofis clear from the name itself ‚Üí to help founders on the X to 10X journey. As their website says: ‚ÄúScaling is hard. We make it easier.‚Äù This is an interesting n::1 business!\n\n‚Ä¶more\n537\n26 comments\n10 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nxto10x\nxto10x\n1 yr 7 mos\n1 yr 7 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India ¬∑ On-site\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India ¬∑ On-site\nSoftware Developer\nSoftware Developer\nFull-time\nFull-time\nMay 2024 - Present ¬∑ 1 yr 3 mos\nMay 2024 to Present ¬∑ 1 yr 3 mos\nSoftware Developer \nSoftware Developer\nInternship\nInternship\nJan 2024 - May 2024 ¬∑ 5 mos\nJan 2024 to May 2024 ¬∑ 5 mos\nFrontend Developer \nFrontend Developer\n88 Ventures ¬∑ Internship\n88 Ventures ¬∑ Internship\nJun 2023 - Aug 2023 ¬∑ 3 mos\nJun 2023 to Aug 2023 ¬∑ 3 mos\nRemote\nRemote\nTypeScript and Front-End Development\nFull-stack Developer\nFull-stack Developer\nFull-stack Developer\nFreelance\nFreelance\nMar 2023 - Jun 2023 ¬∑ 4 mos\nMar 2023 to Jun 2023 ¬∑ 4 mos\nTypeScript\nWeb Developer \nWeb Developer\nNoesis Capital Advisors ¬∑ Internship\nNoesis Capital Advisors ¬∑ Internship\nJan 2023 - Mar 2023 ¬∑ 3 mos\nJan 2023 to Mar 2023 ¬∑ 3 mos\nRemote\nRemote\nManaged and upgraded company's website with SEO\nManaged and upgraded company's website with SEO\nEducation\nEducation\nCHANDIGARH UNIVERSITY\nCHANDIGARH UNIVERSITY\nBachelor of Technology - BTech, Computer Science\nBachelor of Technology - BTech, Computer Science\n2020 - 2024\n2020 - 2024\nP.K.R Jain Public School\nP.K.R Jain Public School\nP.K.R Jain Public School\nHigh School Diploma, Mathematics and Computer Science\nHigh School Diploma, Mathematics and Computer Science\n2019 - 2020\n2019 - 2020\nLicenses & certifications\nLicenses & certifications\nFinancial Markets (with Honors)\nFinancial Markets (with Honors)\nCoursera\nCoursera\nIssued Mar 2021\nIssued Mar 2021\nCredential ID GAKD46VW5TYH\nCredential ID GAKD46VW5TYH\nShow credential\nPayments\nHackerRank certified React Developer\nHackerRank certified React Developer\nHackerRank\nHackerRank\nCredential ID ef1702249fba\nCredential ID ef1702249fba\nShow credential\nFront-End Development and React.js\nHackerRank\nHackerRank\nReact (Basic) Certificate\nReact (Basic) Certificate\nProjects\nProjects\nHulu Clone\nHulu Clone\nApr 2021 - Apr 2021\nApr 2021 - Apr 2021\nShow project\nA Clean \"Hulu\" clone made with NextJS and powerful TailwindCSS\nA Clean \"Hulu\" clone made with NextJS and powerful TailwindCSS\nSkills\nSkills\nPayments\nPayments\nFinancial Markets (with Honors)\nFinancial Markets (with Honors)\nFinancial Markets\nFinancial Markets\nFinTech\nFinTech\nFinancial Markets\nFinancial Markets\nShow all 10 skills\nCourses\nCourses\nFinancial Markets\nFinancial Markets\nGAKD46VW5TYH\nGAKD46VW5TYH\nInterests\nInterests\nTop Voices\nTop Voices\nCompanies\nCompanies\nSchools\nSchools\nNick Singh üìïüêí\nNick Singh üìïüêí\nCEO @ DataLemur (FAANG SQL Interview Prep) ‚Ä¢ Ex-FB & Google ‚Ä¢ Best-Selling Author of 'Ace the Data Science Interview' ‚Ä¢ LinkedIn Top Voice (180,000+ Followers)\nCEO @ DataLemur (FAANG SQL Interview Prep) ‚Ä¢ Ex-FB & Google ‚Ä¢ Best-Selling Author of 'Ace the Data Science Interview' ‚Ä¢ LinkedIn Top Voice (180,000+ Followers)\n183,341 followers\n183,341 followers\nFollow\nVishwastam Shukla\nVishwastam Shukla\nChief Technology Officer at HackerEarth, Ex-Amazon.
