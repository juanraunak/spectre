These conversations have been eye-opening, especially in understanding how women (and moms) navigate career choices in corporate leadership.\n\nHere are some powerful words of wisdom from then:\n\n🔹(my guide, my friend) – \"Timshel—At every point in life, you ALWAYS have a choice. Own your decisions, & never regret them. The choice you made that day was the best one for you.\"\n🔹(my mentor) – \"Every time I look around in a Board meeting, I see a room full of men. Whatever I can do to support women leaders, I will do to my best ability.\"\n🔹(my super senior—at work and in life) – \"You can ALWAYS reset and restart—whether it’s family, job, location, or career. There’s always an option to begin again.\"\n🔹(my colleague-turned-friend) – \"The best thing you can do for yourself is to be honest about your priorities. If you’re not, you’ll always be running someone else’s race.\"\n🔹(my role model) – \"Few people have the privilege to pause and reflect on what they truly want next. If you can, cherish it—it's a superpower!\"\n🔹(my sister, my support) – \"There is nothing in the world that you cannot achieve. You just need to aim for it and believe in yourself\"\n🔹(my twin and my soul sister) – \"Always know your worth. And fight for it. It may not come naturally, but practice until it does.\"\n🔹(my sounding board, my safe space) – \"As moms who take full ownership—both at home and work—we deserve nothing but the best. We should aim to reach a stage in our careers where we control what we do & when we do it.\"\n🔹(my soul sister from Saudi Arabia) – \"There’s no stopping women in leadership who work like founders—even when they aren’t.\" 🚀\n🔹(my aspirational boss) – \"As women, we tend to be humble & less assertive. Set your boundaries and priorities first—only then will others respect them too.\"\n🔹(my favorite boss of all time) – \"Ask for help when you need it—even from your team. You've invested in their growth; when you need support as a mom & leader, let them give back.\" 😊\n🔹(my friend, my colleague, my mirror) – \"As working moms, we constantly juggle different priorities. Build a support system that enables you. Solve for each day and don’t feel guilty—one day, your priority will be work, another day, your child, & the next, your parents. Every choice is valid, as long as YOU make it.\"\n\nThese words aren’t just advice—they’re battle-tested truths from women who’ve been there & done that. And as I navigate my own journey, I hold onto these lessons as my compass. To all the incredible women (& men) out there—what’s the best career advice you’ve ever received? 💡\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/5\nActivate to view larger image,\n384\n36 comments\n3 reposts\nSonali Jain\nSonali Jain\nSonali Jain\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nEmpowering AI startups @ Microsoft | ex - GM, Revenue & GTM at xto10x | ex-McKinsey | IIM-B, SRCC Gold Medalist\nEmpowering AI startups @ Microsoft | ex - GM, Revenue & GTM at xto10x | ex-McKinsey | IIM-B, SRCC Gold Medalist\n10mo • Edited • \n 10 months ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nIt was a privilege to be a part of organising this day that marked the beginning of our journey to supporting companies on their IPO readiness. \n\nA room full of 80 seasoned founders and CFOs, theteam andsir coming from across the country. What better audience can you get!\n\nPenny drop moment was the 'guru-dakshina' we all gave to MDP sir by signing the pledges he engraved in our minds during the keynote.\n\nA standing ovation to you MDP sir & thank you for doing a big-bang launch of our IPO Academy!\n\n…more\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\n   • 3rd+\nVerified • 3rd+\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\nBuilding great public market companies - IPO readiness\n\nOn Friday, we had a wonderful curtain-raiser session for theIPO academy with. Mohan had everyone spellbound for 2.5 hours (no breaks and no one moved!) - sharing the deep learnings from his years as Infosys CFO - on what it means to be truly ready to be a public company. Not just doing the IPO transaction, but being ready for the years of consistent growth and value creation that must come hand-in-hand with the responsibility of taking money from retail shareholders.\n\nThe reality is, many of us in the startup ecosystem are at the risk of missing these six simple truths (\"readiness conditions\") in our preparation to go public:\n1. A unique “disruptor” business model that can outperform peers - with strong visibility into the first 8 quarters of growth/profit performance post-IPO\n2. Ability to give accurate guidance and consistently deliver\n3. An IPO-ready team that can scale with the business\n4. An independent, highly-skilled board - as a competitive advantage\n5. High transparency & 100% compliance\n6. A price that leaves value on the table, ensuring great returns for both new and existing shareholders\n\nAfter Mohan's talk, we did a readiness assessment with the audience of founders/CFOs on where they felt they stood on these six areas. The result was quite revealing (see attached graphic) - with board readiness coming out as the lowest scoring area. One surprise in the self-assessment for me was that consistent quarter-to-quarter performance came out quite high on the readiness score - we know from our work atthat this is something that worries many founders headed to IPO in the next 2-3 years.\n\nThe high point of the session was the manifesto signing where 80+ founders/CFOs (inspired by Mohan's words!) signed a simple statement committing to work towards true readiness before going public. We wrote this manifesto after more than 25 conversations with founders, industry stalwarts, board members, investment bankers, regulators and functional leaders who have gone public - as a simple mission statement of what we should work towards as the startup ecosystem. We will do our best asto provide operating support and act as conscience-keepers to help achieve this goal.\n\nTo read the full manifesto, please feel free to download it from(don't worry, it's not behind a paywall or registration form!). If you have IPO on your mind (who doesn't!!) and would like to discuss some of these readiness areas, please feel free to drop me a line at.\n\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/5\nActivate to view larger image,\n13\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nLead - VC and PE Partnerships | Microsoft for Startups (AI)\nLead - VC and PE Partnerships | Microsoft for Startups (AI)\nMicrosoft · Full-time\nMicrosoft · Full-time\nApr 2025 - Present · 4 mos\nApr 2025 to Present · 4 mos\nI lead Microsoft’s efforts to engage with venture capital and private equity firms in India — with the goal of helping their portfolio companies scale faster using Microsoft’s technology and global reach.\n\nMy focus areas:\n- Building meaningful partnerships with funds across early and growth stages.\n- Helping portfolio startups get access to Azure, GitHub, Copilot, Microsoft for Startups, and our GTM programs.\n- Creating joint opportunities - from curated showcases to thought leadership sessions - that connect innovation with enterprise scale.\n\nIt’s a unique role at the intersection of capital, cloud, and collaboration - and I’m excited to shape what comes next.\nHead of GTM\nHead of GTM\nxto10x Technologies Pvt Ltd · Full-time\nxto10x Technologies Pvt Ltd · Full-time\nApr 2020 - May 2025 · 5 yrs 2 mos\nApr 2020 to May 2025 · 5 yrs 2 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nLed xto10x’s revenue growth from inception, scaling its revenue 10x in four years, acquiring 500+ top startups and establishing xto10x as the go-to partner for scaling, profitability, and IPO readiness.\n\nKey Achievements:\n1.
