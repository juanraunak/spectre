The app showed all the right updates — Packed, Shipped, and even Arriving Today on June 9. Naturally, I was looking forward to the delivery.\n\nBut the sofa never arrived. 🙁\n\nThe status changed to “Delivery Delayed” with standard apology messages. After waiting for 2 more days, I checked the tracking on the delivery partner’s platform (Delhivery), only to find that the item was never picked up and was cancelled by the merchant days ago. 🤷‍♂️\n\nThen why did Myntra show that it was shipped and arriving? Why was I never informed that the order had been cancelled? If I had known, I would’ve placed a new order right away — but instead, I kept waiting.\n\nThis experience has not only wasted my time but also caused major inconvenience — I now have no bed for my guests, and the excitement of setting up my space has turned into frustration.\n\nThank you,, for this broken experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttaching screenshots for reference.\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/2\nActivate to view larger image,\n8\n1 comment\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nSenior Product Designer\nSenior Product Designer\nxto10x · Full-time\nxto10x · Full-time\nMay 2025 - Present · 3 mos\nMay 2025 to Present · 3 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · On-site\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · On-site\nFounding Designer\nFounding Designer\nMoMoney · Full-time\nMoMoney · Full-time\nFeb 2023 - May 2025 · 2 yrs 4 mos\nFeb 2023 to May 2025 · 2 yrs 4 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · Hybrid\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India · Hybrid\nParallel\nParallel\nFull-time · 1 yr 11 mos\nFull-time · 1 yr 11 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nSenior Product Designer\nSenior Product Designer\nJul 2022 - Feb 2023 · 8 mos\nJul 2022 to Feb 2023 · 8 mos\nProduct Designer\nProduct Designer\nApr 2021 - Jun 2022 · 1 yr 3 mos\nApr 2021 to Jun 2022 · 1 yr 3 mos\nLead UX/UI Designer\nLead UX/UI Designer\nDataevolve Solutions · Full-time\nDataevolve Solutions · Full-time\nOct 2019 - Apr 2021 · 1 yr 7 mos\nOct 2019 to Apr 2021 · 1 yr 7 mos\nGreater Hyderabad Area\nGreater Hyderabad Area\nUX/ UI Designer\nUX/ UI Designer\niB Hubs\niB Hubs\nJun 2019 - Sep 2019 · 4 mos\nJun 2019 to Sep 2019 · 4 mos\nShow all 9 experiences\nEducation\nEducation\nJaypee University of Engeenering & Technology, Guna\nJaypee University of Engeenering & Technology, Guna\nBachelor of Technology - BTech, Computer Science\nBachelor of Technology - BTech, Computer Science\n2015 - 2019\n2015 - 2019\nLicenses & certifications\nLicenses & certifications\nBecome a UX Designer from Scratch\nBecome a UX Designer from Scratch\nIxDF - The Interaction Design Foundation\nIxDF - The Interaction Design Foundation\nIssued Aug 2019\nIssued Aug 2019\nCredential ID 48078\nCredential ID 48078\nShow credential\nHuman-Computer Interaction - HCI\nHuman-Computer Interaction - HCI\nIxDF - The Interaction Design Foundation\nIxDF - The Interaction Design Foundation\nIssued Aug 2019\nIssued Aug 2019\nCredential ID 48078\nCredential ID 48078\nShow credential\nShow all 10 licenses & certifications\nSkills\nSkills\nEngineering\nEngineering\nMobile Applications\nMobile Applications\nShow all 50 skills\nRecommendations\nRecommendations\nReceived\nReceived\nGiven\nGiven\nNothing to see for now\nNothing to see for now\nRecommendations that Ashutosh receives will appear here.\nRecommendations thatAshutoshreceives will appear here.\nInterests\nInterests\nTop Voices\nTop Voices\nCompanies\nCompanies\nGroups\nGroups\nNewsletters\nNewsletters\nSchools\nSchools\nAnkit Shukla\nAnkit Shukla\nFounder HelloPM 👋🏽 | Previously - Product Management at Scaler, InterviewBit, INDmoney & SHEROES\nFounder HelloPM 👋🏽 | Previously - Product Management at Scaler, InterviewBit, INDmoney & SHEROES\n95,736 followers\n95,736 followers\nFollow\nVitaly Friedman\nVitaly Friedman\nPractical insights for better UX • Running “Measure UX” and “Smart Interface Design Patterns” • Founder of SmashingMag • Speaker • Loves writing, checklists and running workshops on UX. 🍣\nPractical insights for better UX • Running “Measure UX” and “Smart Interface Design Patterns” • Founder of SmashingMag • Speaker • Loves writing, checklists and running workshops on UX. 🍣\n208,403 followers\n208,403 followers\nFollow\nShow all Top Voices\nMore profiles for you\nMore profiles for you\nDayamay Udaygiri\nDayamay Udaygiri\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\ncollege dropout adding plus1000aura to the internet | 2x sharktank | 16k insta @dayadzn | ex - bluelearn\nFollow\nRishabh Sipani\nRishabh Sipani\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nSenior UI/UX Designer\nSenior UI/UX Designer\nFollow\nUjjwal Sukheja\nUjjwal Sukheja\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nCo-founder Swish - 10-min food delivery app | Hiring in ops, growth & product\nFollow\nKenan Collaco\nKenan Collaco\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nBuilding Zamp, EX- Head of technology: @bluelearn\nBuilding Zamp, EX- Head of technology: @bluelearn\nFollow\nManasvi Saxena\nManasvi Saxena\n· 3rd+\n3rd+ degree connection\nCo-Founder at MoMoney - Saving and investing made simple | Ex-FamPay (YC S19), BetterPlace\nFollow\nShow all\nPeople you may know\nPeople you may know\nFrom Ashutosh's school\nFrom Ashutosh's school\nNirdesh singh\nNirdesh singh\nPower plant Desk operation engineer at BAJAJ ENERGY LIMITED.
