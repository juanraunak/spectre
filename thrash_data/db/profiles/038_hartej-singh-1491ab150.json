And, on 9th Feb ‚Äò22, Binny topped the company up with $25M in funding (from his own pocket). We don‚Äôt have latest data on company performance, since it is SG domiciled, but FY23 was ~$14M in revenue & profitable.\n\nxto10x combines the traditional ‚ÄòMcKinsey model‚Äô i.e. consulting (70% of revenue) with a ‚Äòbuilders approach‚Äô i.e. product / software led engagements (30% of revenue)\n\n‚ÄúPeopleCues‚Äù is their software platform, priced at ~$8 per seat per month, which comprises\n\n(a) OKR management\n(b) Performance management\n(c) Culture & Employee NPS (eNPS)\n\nIn addition to the software, they offer consulting services like:\n(1) Coaching ‚Üí Pre-IPO coaching & founder coaching\n(2) Strategy ‚Üí Org Design, Leadership hiring etc\n(3) Hands-on ‚Üí Growth engine design & implementation\n\nüí°Very similar to McKinsey & its MBB peers, xto10x focuses on having small teams working deeply with large clients (200+ names including CRED, Groww, Razorpay, Meesho etc). Btw, many people don‚Äôt know that McKinsey also has a LOT of software which it sells to clients (topic for another post) - so the two firms are quite similar!\n\nWhat makes xto10x unique is that alongside consulting fees, it sometimes take an equity stake in companies it works with ‚Üí per TRACXN, it has equity in ~35 companies (mostly at the Series B stage). HENCE, it has real skin in the game üí™\n\n‚û°Ô∏èThe goal ofis clear from the name itself ‚Üí to help founders on the X to 10X journey. As their website says: ‚ÄúScaling is hard. We make it easier.‚Äù This is an interesting n::1 business!\n\n‚Ä¶more\n537\n26 comments\n10 reposts\nHartej Singh\nHartej Singh\n   ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nPremium ‚Ä¢ 3rd+\nHelping startups scale at xto10x | Former Sales & Digital Marketing Manager at Bajaj Auto | MBA (International Business), IIFT Delhi\nHelping startups scale at xto10x | Former Sales & Digital Marketing Manager at Bajaj Auto | MBA (International Business), IIFT Delhi\n2w ‚Ä¢ \n 2 weeks ago ‚Ä¢ Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nI‚Äôm happy to share that I‚Äôve obtained a new certification: Google Digital Marketing and E-Commerce Professional Certificate from Coursera!\nCelebrating a New Certification\n36\n5 comments\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nOperations excellence\nOperations excellence\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nxto10x ¬∑ Full-time\nOct 2024 -
