Created impact in 50+ startups across key areas of scaling like burn reduction, ops & supply chain design, input tracking & governance, and workforce management. 10+ years of experience in scaling up internet kitchens, food delivery, fitness, e-commerce and FMCG supply chain.\nFeatured\nFeatured\nPost\nPost\nOver the last 13 years, I’ve had a ring side view of the startup ecosystem through my journey helping scale,and 50+ startups as part of. While there are many milestones in a startup’s journey, none come close to the dream of having a successful IPO. It’s great to see the evolution of the ecosystem to a place where this dream is becoming a real possibility for many startups.\n\nAt xto10x, our mission is to help great startups transform product-market fit and initial momentum into world-class, at-scale companies. A crucial milestone in that journey is the transition to the public markets. 75+ startups from the Indian startup ecosystem are planning to do just that in the near future. We feel privileged to be able to play a meaningful role in their journeys through the xto10x IPO Academy — the ultimate launchpad for founders aiming to go public in the next two to three years.\n\nThis will be a cohort-based program for startup founders who are planning to go public soon and will cover the entire “wish-list” of topics to get IPO ready. We have an outstanding star cast of faculty composed of public market investors, industry stalwarts, ex-SEBI officials, i-bankers, founders who’ve taken their companies public, and more.\n\nClick the link below to register for the curtain-raiser: “Setting higher standards to build enduring public companies” by Mohandas Pai, open to all startup founders and CXOs. This session is scheduled on 13th September in Bangalore.\n\n\n\n35\nPost\nPost\nI wrote a series of posts on \nhashtag\n#linkedin a couple of years back on \n#operations excellence topics like control tower, planning, operations design, managing blue collared employees and customer experience. There was a steely resolve to convert these thoughts into a playbook that could be useful for the\necosystem. I then joined xto10x and as a team we worked with more than 30\ncompanies where we applied these concepts and helped them succeed. We then articulated these into practical frameworks & actionable insights that we believed could help many other startups in their growth phase. This was the genesis of the 10xOps Academy, a 10 week program in Operations Excellence for founders & Ops leaders. It’s intended to help decode all the necessary capabilities for scaling operations while allowing companies to go deep on 1-2 critical areas - with an objective of helping create a Ops excellence roadmap for the next 18 months.\nWas great to see this vision come to life as our first ever batch of\ngraduated this week. Heartfelt gratitude & congratulations toteams.\nAs our second batch is set to kickoff next week, I’m excited about the widespread impact this program can have across the ecosystem.\nCongratulations to our Batch-1 graduates!\n34\nPost\nPost\nWe’re signing up companies for the second 10x Ops Academy batch that’s set to start in mid Feb.\n\nPing me if you’re looking to scale your operations setup - this could be the single most important step you take to setup your operations for success.\n\nLooking forward to 2 months of learning and impact with rockstar founders and ops leaders.\n10x Ops Academy | New program launch\n24\nPost\nPost\nI recently completed 2 outstanding years at.\n\nAs I reflect - I feel satisfaction & gratitude on one hand, and hunger & belief on the other.\n\nhashtag\n#satisfactionabout how I have evolved as an individual - 10x better problem solver, 10x better at conversations, 10x more mindful. Satisfaction that our work during this time has created loads of impact in the\n.\n\ntowards the entire\necosystem that has welcomed me and the offerings that I have taken to them. Gratitude towards the entireteam for being great friends & mentors. Gratitude towards my Ops & CX Practice team - who have always been with me through highs of success and the anxiety of creation. It’s deeply inspiring to be on a team of achievers & well wishers.\n\nto achieve much more individually & as a company - each of the modules we have developed has found relevance in its own big way and there’s impatience to crack the code on every meaningful problem that startups face during their hyper growth stage.\n\nthat we are onto something magical as a company and the only people who can stop us is ourselves if we fall out of the cycle of dreaming, experimenting and making it happen.\n\nWe are just getting started.\n\nI’m just getting started.\nActivity\nActivity\n8,537 followers\n8,537 followers\nPosts\nComments\nVideos\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nPawan Raghuveer\nPawan Raghuveer\nPawan Raghuveer\n   • 3rd+\nPremium • 3rd+\nOperations Excellence at xto10x\nOperations Excellence at xto10x\n1mo • Edited • \n 1 month ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nWe successfully concluded the scaling companies by xto10x program this week under the aegis of MonshaatSA \n\nOver the last few months, we’ve been engaged with 15 exciting companies fromon different scaling topics like business design, org design and leadership, branding and marketing, operations excellence, and people excellence.

The magic? It wasn’t just about learning—it was about collective problem-solving seeded by‘s tested frameworks, real-life case studies, and rich founder experiences. Every question sparked insights. Every challenge turned into a shared opportunity for growth.\n\nWe deep-dived into logistics and warehouse costs and levers to control them, the true impact of delivery speed and accurate promise on profitability, the constant trade-off between cost efficiency and customer delight, and in the process we busted myths like “faster = costlier”\n\nThe outcome? Actionable takeaways, new ways of thinking, and a community of founders helping each other win.\n\nCheck out the highlights to see these powerful conversations in action.\n\nBig thanks to all the founders who made these sessions truly special with their openness and insight.\n\nGagandeep M.\n\n…more\n133\n1 comment\n9 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nGeneral Manager\nGeneral Manager\nxto10x · Full-time\nxto10x · Full-time\nNov 2020 -
