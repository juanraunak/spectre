But how could we do justice to such a complex topic?\n\nOur approach was to do extensive research with 25+ leaders who have experience of the public markets - from stalwarts to founders who’ve gone public recently. We would like to express our gratitude to a few who've gone above and beyond.\n\nhas a rare gift — ask a question, and he gives an answer that is a masterclass. We requested an hour of his time. He said, “Why only an hour? I’ll spend a full day. Bring all the founders you can.” He then talked us through the standards that can help startups become enduring public companies. That conversation led to an event where 80+ founders and CFOs signed a manifesto committing to build great listed companies — the perfect curtain-raiser for the Academy. Mohan’s passion for India is contagious.\n\n: For those who know Harsh, it won’t be a surprise that he had an almost ready-made playbook to build a board into a competitive advantage — refined over decades at Marico. Harsh introduced us to Hema Ravichandar (former NRC chair at Marico), who led a deeply practical discussion alongside Harsh on board management. Harsh spends serious time on preparation; in meetings, he listens carefully and answers every question; after, he always asks for feedback. Despite all he’s achieved, his simplicity and sincerity are remarkable.\n\nR Srinivasan: As CIO at SBI MF, Vasan plays a key role in India’s largest fund, but you’d never guess that from his humility and warmth. Within an hour of meeting, he busted several myths about public-market investors, and rattled off 10 books that inform his world view - from “Six Easy Pieces” by Feynman to “An Immense World” by Ed Yong. What does this have to do with investing? You’ll have to hear Vasan speak about the “Art and Science of Investing” to know the answer!\n\n(PB Fintech),(Ixigo),(Awfis): A program like this is incomplete without founders who have recently been through the IPO journey. If the other faculty are “professors”, then Alok, Aloke and Amit are “knowledgeable seniors” who deeply empathise with IPO-bound founders and have so much to share — how to prepare, what to do, and what to avoid. Their thoughtfulness, depth and genuine caring for other founders makes them special.\n\n,,,: One of our more fun events was with the JM Financial team - a quiz, valuation game and analyst coverage game - to help founders build a deeper appreciation for public markets. Everyone says i-bankers are focused only on the IPO event, but the JM team has shown their willingness to go above and beyond!\n\nIt takes a village… and we’ve had the blessings of the village “elders”. I look forward to sharing more next week!\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/8\nActivate to view larger image,\n298\n10 comments\n9 reposts\nJeeva Thomas reposted this\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\nSaikiran Krishnamurthy\n   • 3rd+\nVerified • 3rd+\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\nCo-founder & CEO, xto10x Technologies\n10mo • \n 10 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nBuilding great public market companies - IPO readiness\n\nOn Friday, we had a wonderful curtain-raiser session for theIPO academy with. Mohan had everyone spellbound for 2.5 hours (no breaks and no one moved!) - sharing the deep learnings from his years as Infosys CFO - on what it means to be truly ready to be a public company. Not just doing the IPO transaction, but being ready for the years of consistent growth and value creation that must come hand-in-hand with the responsibility of taking money from retail shareholders.\n\nThe reality is, many of us in the startup ecosystem are at the risk of missing these six simple truths (\"readiness conditions\") in our preparation to go public:\n1. A unique “disruptor” business model that can outperform peers - with strong visibility into the first 8 quarters of growth/profit performance post-IPO\n2. Ability to give accurate guidance and consistently deliver\n3. An IPO-ready team that can scale with the business\n4. An independent, highly-skilled board - as a competitive advantage\n5. High transparency & 100% compliance\n6. A price that leaves value on the table, ensuring great returns for both new and existing shareholders\n\nAfter Mohan's talk, we did a readiness assessment with the audience of founders/CFOs on where they felt they stood on these six areas. The result was quite revealing (see attached graphic) - with board readiness coming out as the lowest scoring area. One surprise in the self-assessment for me was that consistent quarter-to-quarter performance came out quite high on the readiness score - we know from our work atthat this is something that worries many founders headed to IPO in the next 2-3 years.\n\nThe high point of the session was the manifesto signing where 80+ founders/CFOs (inspired by Mohan's words!) signed a simple statement committing to work towards true readiness before going public. We wrote this manifesto after more than 25 conversations with founders, industry stalwarts, board members, investment bankers, regulators and functional leaders who have gone public - as a simple mission statement of what we should work towards as the startup ecosystem. We will do our best asto provide operating support and act as conscience-keepers to help achieve this goal.\n\nTo read the full manifesto, please feel free to download it from(don't worry, it's not behind a paywall or registration form!). If you have IPO on your mind (who doesn't!!) and would like to discuss some of these readiness areas, please feel free to drop me a line at.\n\n…more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/5\nActivate to view larger image,\n328\n8 comments\n15 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nxto10x\nxto10x\nFull-time · 2 yrs 11 mos\nFull-time · 2 yrs 11 mos\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nEA to CEO & COO\nEA to CEO & COO\nFeb 2024 -
